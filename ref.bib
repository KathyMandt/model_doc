  abstract = {A key step in valuing petroleum investment opportunities is to construct
	a model that portrays the uncertainty inherent in the investment
	decision. In almost all such cases, several of the random variables
	that are relevant for the model are correlated. Properly accounting
	for and modelling these correlations is essential in deriving reliable
	valuations for decision support. The Envelope method and the Iman-Conover
	method are popular approaches to model dependency in the petroleum
	industry. Although these models work well in many cases, there are
	situations where they fail to accurately account for important characteristics
	of the correlations. In many cases the structure of the dependence
	between two random variables is important. The approaches typically
	used to model dependence in oil and gas evaluations often fail to
	address the dependence structure. The copulas technique, which is
	well known in financial risk management and insurance applications,
	has proven to be a superior tool for modelling dependency structures.
	Yet, to our knowledge, it has rarely been used in petroleum applications.
	A copula is a statistical concept that relates random variables.
	It is a function that links the marginal distributions to the joint
	distribution. A copula can model the dependence structure given any
	type of marginal distribution, which is not possible with other correlation
	measures. This is illustrated by the fact that the copula approach
	is able to separate the marginal distribution from the correlation.
	The objective of this paper is to illustrate the potential benefits
	of using copulas to model dependencies in oil and gas applications
	with a particular focus on the reserves problem. This paper introduces
	the copulas method and then compares and contrasts it with some of
	the more commonly used approaches to model dependence. We then show
	that the traditional methods have problems in accurately revealing
	the dependence structure in the tails of the variable distributions.
	Finally, we illustrate how the dependence structure can be captured
	and modelled using the copulas approach.},

  abstract = {Summary Water is critical for economic growth in coastal areas. In
	this context, desalination has become an increasingly important technology
	over the last five decades. It often has environmental side effects,
	especially when the input water is pumped directly from the sea via
	intake pipelines. However, it is generally more efficient and cheaper
	to desalt brackish groundwater from beach wells rather than desalting
	seawater. Natural attenuation is also gained and hazards due to anthropogenic
	pollution of seawater are reduced. In order to minimize allocation
	and operational costs and impacts on groundwater resources, an optimum
	pumping network is required. Optimization techniques are often applied
	to this end. Because of aquifer heterogeneity, designing the optimum
	pumping network demands reliable characterizations of aquifer parameters.
	An optimum pumping network in a coastal aquifer in Oman, where a
	desalination plant currently pumps brackish groundwater at a rate
	of 1200 m3/h for a freshwater production of 504 m3/h (insufficient
	to satisfy the growing demand in the area) was designed using stochastic
	inverse modeling together with optimization techniques. The Monte
	Carlo analysis of 200 simulations of transmissivity and storage coefficient
	fields conditioned to the response to stresses of tidal fluctuation
	and three long term pumping tests was performed. These simulations
	are physically plausible and fit the available data well. Simulated
	transmissivity fields are used to design the optimum pumping configuration
	required to increase the current pumping rate to 9000 m3/h, for a
	freshwater production of 3346 m3/h (more than six times larger than
	the existing one). For this task, new pumping wells need to be sited
	and their pumping rates defined. These unknowns are determined by
	a genetic algorithm that minimizes a function accounting for: (1)
	drilling, operational and maintenance costs, (2) target discharge
	and minimum drawdown (i.e., minimum aquifer vulnerability) and (3)
	technical feasibility of the solution. The performance of the optimum
	pumping network is compared to that of a synthetic, tradition-based
	hand-delineated design, where optimization is not performed. Results
	show that the combined use of stochastic inverse modeling and optimization
	techniques leads to minimum side effects (e.g., drawdowns in the
	area are reduced substantially) and to a significant reduction of
	allocation and operational costs.},

  number = {Special Issue 03},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT Numerous studies over the past 30 years have suggested there
	is a causal connection between the motion of the Sun through the
	Galaxy and terrestrial mass extinctions or climate change. Proposed
	mechanisms include comet impacts (via perturbation of the Oort cloud),
	cosmic rays and supernovae, the effects of which are modulated by
	the passage of the Sun through the Galactic midplane or spiral arms.
	Supposed periodicities in the fossil record, impact cratering dates
	or climate proxies over the Phanerozoic (past 545 Myr) are frequently
	cited as evidence in support of these hypotheses. This remains a
	controversial subject, with many refutations and replies having been
	published. Here I review both the mechanisms and the evidence for
	and against the relevance of astronomical phenomena to climate change
	and evolution. This necessarily includes a critical assessment of
	time series analysis techniques and hypothesis testing. Some of the
	studies have suffered from flaws in methodology, in particular drawing
	incorrect conclusions based on ruling out a null hypothesis. I conclude
	that there is little evidence for intrinsic periodicities in biodiversity,
	impact cratering or climate on timescales of tens to hundreds of
	Myr. Although this does not rule out the mechanisms, the numerous
	assumptions and uncertainties involved in the interpretation of the
	geological data and in particular in the astronomical mechanisms
	suggest that Galactic midplane and spiral arm crossings have little
	impact on biological or climate variation above background level.
	Non-periodic impacts and terrestrial mechanisms (volcanism, plate
	tectonics, sea level changes), possibly occurring simultaneously,
	remain likely causes of many environmental catastrophes. Internal
	dynamics of the biosphere may also play a role. In contrast, there
	is little evidence supporting the idea that cosmic rays have a significant
	influence on climate through cloud formation. It seems likely that
	more than one mechanism has contributed to biodiversity variations
	over the past half Gyr.},

	complemented by new relativistic distorted-wave calculations for

  pages = {551},
  abstract = {It has been observed that the first pages of a table of common logarithms
	show more wear than do the last pages, indicating that more used
	numbers begin with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. A compilation
	of some 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent sources shows
	that there is a logarithmic distribution of first digits when the
	numbers are composed of four or more digits. An analysis of the numbers
	from different sources shows that the numbers taken from unrelated
	subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a much better
	agreement with a logarithmic distribution than do numbers from mathematical
	tabulations or other formal data. There is here the peculiar fact
	that numbers that individually are without relationship are, when
	considered in large groups, in good agreement with a distribution
	law-hence the name "Anomalous Numbers." A further analysis of the
	data shows a strong tendency for bodies of numerical data to fall
	into geometric series. If the series is made up of numbers containing
	three or more digits the first digits form a logarithmic series.
	If the numbers contain only single digits the geometric relation
	still holds but the simple logarithmic relation no longer applies.
	An equation is given showing the frequencies of first digits in the
	different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10 to 100, etc. The equation
	also gives the frequency of digits in the second, third... place
	of a multi-digit number, and it is shown that the same law applies
	to reciprocals. There are many instances showing that the geometric
	series, or the logarithmic law, has long been recognized as a common
	phenomenon in factual literature and in the ordinary affairs of life.
	The wire gauge and drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude scale
	of the astronomer and the sensory response curves of the psychologist
	are all particular examples of a relationship that seems to extend
	to all human affairs. The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a general
	probability law of widespread application.},

	their uncertainties. Comparisons with experimental data show that
	gas-phase rate uncertainties do not explain the disagreements at
	higher pressures ($>$30 mTorr). We also find that electron impact
	dissociation reactions of dominant neutrals are the largest sources
	of uncertainties. HF kinetics are also found to be critical in determining
	radical and feedstock gas densities. Relative ion densities are uncertain
	due to poor understanding of charge transfer mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The global hydrogen Lyman α, helium (584 angstroms), and molecular
	hydrogen band emissions from Saturn are qualitatively similar to

	H$_{2}$ band excitation mechanism is closely related to the solar
	flux. Auroras occur near 80° latitude, suggesting Earth-like magnetotail
	activity, quite different from the dominant Io plasma torus mechanism
	at Jupiter. No ion emissions have been detected from the magnetosphere
	of Saturn, but the rings have a hydrogen atmosphere; atomic hydrogen
	is also present in a torus between 8 and 25 Saturn radii. Nitrogen
	emission excited by particles has been detected in the Titan dayglow
	and bright limb scans. Enhancement of the nitrogen emission is observed
	in the region of interaction between Titan's atmosphere and the corotating
	plasma in Saturn's plasmasphere. No particle-excited emission has
	been detected from the dark atmosphere of Titan. The absorption profile
	of the atmosphere determined by the solar occultation experiment,
	combined with constraints from the dayglow observations and temperature
	information, indicate that N$_{2}$ is the dominant species. A double
	layer structure has been detected above Titan's limb. One of the
	layers may be related to visible layers in the images of Titan.},

  abstract = {Non-linear regression (NLR) analysis in chemometric applications is
	the main subject of the paper. The following novel items of NLR procedure
	are reported. The modification of gradient method is considered.
	For inversion of the Fisher matrix the recurrence algorithm based
	on the matrix exponential is used. A new method of sequential Bayesian
	estimation allows processing of the data successively for every response.
	Each data set is fitted individually, but taking into account the
	information about common parameters estimated on previous data sets.
	A posterior Bayesian distribution is built after every set processing.
	A new method of confidence estimation is suggested. Unlike bootstrap,
	not initial data but parameter estimates are simulated. This method
	has the same accuracy as bootstrap but is about 1000 times faster.
	A new coefficient of non-linearity is introduced. It is calculated
	by the Monte Carlo procedure and accounts for the model structure
	as well as the experimental design features. All new ideas were implemented
	in the software FITTER, a new Excel Add-In. Its main capabilities
	are reported. The paper is illustrated with a number of practical
	examples in DSC, TMA and TGA data analysis. Copyright © 2000 John

	(2) to compare results of blind theoretical modeling of j(NO2) and

	choices between alternative quantum yield and cross-section data.
	The findings of the IPMMI experiment are described in a series of

	atmospheric composition was recently shown with a reactor simulating
	the global chemistry occurring in Titan’s atmosphere (Gautier et
	al. [2011]. Icarus, 213, 625–635). Here we present a complementary
	study on the same reactor using an in situ diagnostic of the gas
	phase composition. Various initial N2/CH4 gas mixtures (methane varying
	from 1% to 10%) are studied, with a monitoring of the methane consumption
	and of the stable gas neutrals by in situ mass spectrometry. Atomic
	hydrogen is also measured by optical emission spectroscopy. A positive
	correlation is found between atomic hydrogen abundance and the inhibition
	function for aerosol production. This confirms the suspected role
	of hydrogen as an inhibitor of heterogeneous organic growth processes,
	as found in Sciamma-O’Brien et al. (Sciamma-O’Brien et al. [2010].
	Icarus, 209, 704–714). The study of the gas phase organic products
	is focussed on its evolution with the initial methane amount [CH4]0
	and its comparison with the aerosol production efficiency. We identify
	a change in the stationary gas phase composition for intermediate
	methane amounts: below [CH4]0&#xa0;=&#xa0;5%, the gas phase composition
	is mainly dominated by nitrogen-containing species, whereas hydrocarbons
	are massively produced for [CH4]0&#xa0;&gt;&#xa0;5%. This predominance
	of N-containing species at lower initial methane amount, compared
	with the maximum gas-to solid conversion observed in Sciamma-O’Brien
	et al. (2010) for identical methane amounts confirms the central
	role played by N-containing gas-phase compounds to produce tholins.
	Moreover, two protonated imines (methanimine \{CH2NH\} and ethanamine
	CH3CHNH) are detected in the ion composition in agreement with Titan’s
	\{INMS\} measurements, and reinforcing the suspected role of these
	chemical species on aerosol production. },

	capacitively coupled plasma radio frequency discharge in a N2âCH4
	stationnary flux. Samples of Titanâs tholins are produced in gaseous
	mixtures containing either 2 or 10% methane before the plasma discharge,
	covering the methane concentration range measured in Titanâs atmosphere.
	We study their solubility and associated morphology, their infrared
	spectroscopy signature and the mass distribution of the soluble fraction
	by mass spectrometry. An important result is to highlight that the
	previous Titanâs tholin solubility studies are inappropriate to
	fully characterize such a heterogeneous organic matter and we develop
	a new protocol to evaluate quantitatively tholins solubility. We
	find that tholins contain up to 35% in mass of molecules soluble
	in methanol, attached to a hardly insoluble fraction. Methanol is
	then chosen as a discriminating solvent to characterize the differences
	between soluble and insoluble species constituting the bulk tholins.
	No significant morphological change of shape or surface feature is
	derived from scanning electron microscopy after the extraction of
	the soluble fraction. This observation suggests a solid structure
	despite an important porosity of the grains. Infrared spectroscopy
	is recorded for both fractions. The IR spectra of the bulk, soluble,
	and insoluble tholins fractions are found to be very similar and
	reveal identical chemical signatures of nitrogen bearing functions
	and aliphatic groups. This result confirms that the chemical information
	collected when analyzing only the soluble fraction provides a valuable
	insight representative of the bulk material. The soluble fraction
	is ionized with an atmospheric pressure photoionization source and
	analyzed by a hybrid mass spectrometer. The congested mass spectra
	with one peak at every mass unit between 50 and 800 u confirm that
	the soluble fraction contains a complex mixture of organic molecules.
	The broad distribution, however, exhibits a regular pattern of mass
	clusters. Tandem collision induced dissociation analysis is performed
	in the negative ion mode to retrieve structural information. It reveals
	that (i) the molecules are ended by methyl, amine and cyanide groups,
	(ii) a 27 u neutral moiety (most probably HCN) is often released
	in the fragmentation of tholin anions, and (iii) an ubiquitous ionic
	fragment at m/z 66 is found in all tandem spectra. A tentative structure
	is proposed for this negative ion.},

	effects are observed in the changes of cross-section values of these
	two molecules and are attributed to their high vibrational frequencies

	(E)- and (Z)-1-azapropen-2-yl radicals, CH3CNH, (3 and 4, respectively)
	that represent the kinetically and thermodynamically forbidden adducts

	an excess of internal energy due to FranckCondon effects and rapidly
	dissociate by loss of the imine hydrogen atom, a methyl hydrogen,
	and by CH3---CNH bond cleavage. The branching ratios for the loss
	of the imine hydrogen (H or D) and methyl group (CH3 or CD3) were
	determined for CH3CNH, CD3CNH, CH3CND, and CD3CND as 70/30, 66/34,
	43/57, and 61/39, respectively. Ab initio calculations with coupled
	clusters with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations/aug-cc-pVTZ
	predict the loss of the imine hydrogen from 4 to have the lowest
	transition-state energy. The calculated branching ratios that were
	based on RiceRamspergerKasselMarcus (RRKM) unimolecular rate constants
	agreed with the mass spectrometric data within experimental accuracy.
	However, the loss of the methyl hydrogen is predicted by RRKM to
	be incompetitive (<0.1%) on the ground doublet electronic states
	of 3 and 4. The observed fraction (10%) is presumed to occur from

	on Titan from 70° S to 70° N with a variety of emission angles. We
	study the molecular signatures observed in the mid-infrared CIRS
	detector arrays (FP3 and FP4, covering roughly the 600-1500 cm-1
	spectral range with apodized resolutions of 2.54 or 0.53 cm-1). The
	composite spectrum shows several molecular signatures: hydrocarbons,
	nitriles and CO2. A firm detection of benzene (C6H6) is provided
	by CIRS at levels of about 3.5×10-9 around 70° N. We have used temperature
	profiles retrieved from the inversion of the emission observed in
	the methane [nu]4 band at 1304 cm-1 and a line-by-line radiative
	transfer code to infer the abundances of the trace constituents and
	some of their isotopes in Titan's stratosphere. No longitudinal variations
	were found for these gases. Little or no change is observed generally
	in their abundances from the south to the equator. On the other hand,
	meridional variations retrieved for these trace constituents from
	the equator to the North ranged from almost zero (no or very little
	meridional variations) for C2H2, C2H6, C3H8, C2H4 and CO2 to a significant
	enhancement at high northern (early winter) latitudes for HCN, HC3N,
	C4H2, C3H4 and C6H6. For the more important increases in the northern
	latitudes, the transition occurs roughly between 30 and 50 degrees
	north latitude, depending on the molecule. Note however that the
	very high-northern latitude results from tours TB-T10 bear large
	uncertainties due to few available data and problems with latitude
	smearing effects. The observed variations are consistent with some,
	but not all, of the predictions from dynamical-photochemical models.
	Constraints are set on the vertical distribution of C2H2, found to
	be compatible with 2-D equatorial predictions by global circulation
	models. The D/H ratio in the methane on Titan has been determined
	from the CH3D band at 1156 cm-1 and found to be . Implications of
	this deuterium enrichment, with respect to the protosolar abundance
	on the origin of Titan, are discussed. We compare our results with

	(ISO) results and with the latest Cassini-Huygens inferences from

  abstract = {[ 1] On October 26, 2004, during its first encounter with Titan (
	Ta), the Cassini Orbiter moved from the dayside to the nightside
	with a closest approach altitude of 1174 km. In situ measurements
	of the main part of Titan's ionosphere were made by the Langmuir
	probe on the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Experiment ( RPWS), while
	the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer ( INMS) measured the main constituents
	of the neutral atmosphere. The results of model calculations of Titan's
	ionosphere for Ta encounter conditions ( e. g., near the terminator)
	are presented in this paper. The paper includes comparisons of calculated
	and measured electron densities along the spacecraft track. Ionization
	both by solar radiation and by incoming energetic electrons from
	Saturn's magnetosphere are needed to obtain good agreement between
	the measured and calculated electron densities.},

	rates caused by this precipitation are calculated using fluxes of

	We demonstrate that energetic oxygen ions do not penetrate below
	about 650 km, but they can also generate significant ionization.
	We suggest that a few percent of the oxygen flux is converted to
	negative O ions as a consequence of charge exchange collisions, which

	on the CH bond cleavage in a single collision reaction with Cl and
	in dissociative adsorption on a Ni surface bear some striking similarities.
	Both reactions are bond-selective processes in which the initial
	preparation of a molecular eigenstate containing a large component
	of CH stretching results in preferential cleavage of that bond. It
	is possible to cleave either the CH bond or CD bond in the reaction
	of Cl with CH3D, CH2D2, or CHD3 and, similarly, to use initial excitation
	of the CH stretch to promote dissociation of CHD3 to CD3 and H on
	a Ni surface. Different vibrational modes, such as the symmetric
	and antisymmetric stretches in CH3D or CH4, lead to very different
	reactivities, and molecules with the symmetric stretching vibration
	excited can be as much as 10 times more reactive than ones with the
	antisymmetric stretch excited. The origin of this behavior lies in
	the change in the vibrational motion induced by the interaction with
	the atomic reaction partner or the surface.},

  abstract = {We present our analysis of the diurnal variations of Titan's ionosphere
	(between 1000 and 1300 km) based on a sample of Ion Neutral Mass
	Spectrometer (INMS) measurements in the Open Source Ion (OSI) mode
	obtained from eight close encounters of the Cassini spacecraft with
	Titan. Although there is an overall ion depletion well beyond the
	terminator, the ion content on Titan's nightside is still appreciable,
	with a density plateau of &#8764;700 cm&#8722;3 below &#8764;1300
	km. Such a plateau is a combined result of significant depletion
	of light ions and modest depletion of heavy ones on Titan's nightside.
	We propose that the distinctions between the diurnal variations of
	light and heavy ions are associated with their different chemical
	loss pathways, with the former primarily through &#8220;fast&#8221;
	ion-neutral chemistry and the latter through &#8220;slow&#8221; electron
	dissociative recombination. The strong correlation between the observed
	night-to-day ion density ratios and the associated ion lifetimes
	suggests a scenario in which the ions created on Titan's dayside
	may survive well to the nightside. The observed asymmetry between
	the dawn and dusk ion density profiles also supports such an interpretation.
	We construct a time-dependent ion chemistry model to investigate
	the effect of ion survival associated with solid body rotation alone
	as well as superrotating horizontal winds. For long-lived ions, the
	predicted diurnal variations have similar general characteristics
	to those observed. However, for short-lived ions, the model densities
	on the nightside are significantly lower than the observed values.
	This implies that electron precipitation from Saturn's magnetosphere
	may be an additional and important contributor to the densities of
	the short-lived ions observed on Titan's nightside.},

	various neutral species in Titan's upper atmosphere, between 950
	and 1,500 km for abundant species (N2, CH4, H2) and between 950 and
	1,200 km for other minor species. Our analysis is based on a large
	sample of Cassini/INMS (Ion Neutral Mass Spectrometer) measurements
	in the CSN (Closed Source Neutral) mode, obtained during 15 close
	flybys of Titan. To untangle the overlapping cracking patterns, we
	adopt Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to determine simultaneously
	the densities of different species. Except for N2, CH4, H2 and 40Ar
	(as well as their isotopes), all species present density enhancements
	measured during the outbound legs. This can be interpreted as a result
	of wall effects, which could be either adsorption/desorption of these
	molecules or heterogeneous surface chemistry of the associated radicals
	on the chamber walls. In this paper, we provide both direct inbound
	measurements assuming ram pressure enhancement only and abundances
	corrected for wall adsorption/desorption based on a simple model
	to reproduce the observed time behavior. Among all minor species
	of photochemical interest, we have firm detections of C2H2, C2H4,
	C2H6, CH3C2H, C4H2, C6H6, CH3CN, HC3N, C2N2 and NH3 in Titan's upper
	atmosphere. Upper limits are given for other minor species. The globally
	averaged distributions of N2, CH4 and H2 are each modeled with the
	diffusion approximation. The N2 profile suggests an average thermospheric
	temperature of 151 K. The CH4 and H2 profiles constrain their fluxes
	to be and , referred to Titan's surface. Both fluxes are significantly
	higher than the Jeans escape values. The INMS data also suggest horizontal/diurnal
	variations of temperature and neutral gas distribution in Titan's
	thermosphere. The equatorial region, the ramside, as well as the
	nightside hemisphere of Titan appear to be warmer and present some
	evidence for the depletion of light species such as CH4. Meridional
	variations of some heavy species are also observed, with a trend
	of depletion toward the north pole. Though some of the above variations
	might be interpreted by either the solar-driven models or auroral-driven
	models, a physical scenario that reconciles all the observed horizontal/diurnal
	variations in a consistent way is still missing. With a careful evaluation
	of the effect of restricted sampling, some of the features shown
	in the INMS data are more likely to be observational biases.},

  abstract = {Much emphasis has been devoted recently to the experimental determination
	of absolute electron-impact ionization cross sections of molecules
	and radicals because of the importance of these cross sections in
	many applications (e.g. as input parameters to modeling codes for
	various purposes). Supporting theoretical calculations have been
	lagging behind to some extent. Because of the inherent complexity
	of such calculations, simplistic additivity rules and semiempirical
	methods have often been used in place of more rigorous calculation
	schemes, particularly in applications where a larger number of cross
	section data were needed with reasonable precision. Although these
	methods have often proved to be quite successful as descriptive tools
	(i.e. reproducing existing experimental ionization cross sections
	reasonably well), their ability to calculate cross sections for species
	for which no experimental data are available (predictive capabilities)
	tend to be limited or questionable. This topical review describes
	recent progress in the development of more rigorous approaches for
	the calculation of absolute electron-impact molecular ionization
	cross sections. The main emphasis will be on the application of the
	semiclassical Deutsch-Mark (DM) formalism, which was originally developed
	for the calculation of atomic ionization cross sections, to molecular
	targets, and on the binary-encounter-Bethe (BEB) method of Kim and
	Rudd. The latter is a simpler version of the more rigorous binary-encounter-dipole
	(BED) theory, which was also first developed for the calculation
	of atomic ionization cross sections, and based on the methods developed
	by Khare and co-workers. Extensive comparisons between available
	experimental cross sections and the predictions of these theoretical
	models will be made for 31 molecules and free radicals (H2, N2, O2,

	in the experimental literature for thermodynamic property measurements
	with determinations of critical temperature for pure compounds used
	as a case study. The time period considered is from 1940 to the present,
	with an emphasis on results published since 1990. One hundred ninety-four
	articles were considered involving hundreds of compounds. The goals
	of this paper are to show how the nature and extent of estimations
	of uncertainty have changed in this time period and to document the
	extent to which the information provided in the articles corresponds
	to the recommendations of the GUM. (The GUM is the Guide to the Expression
	of Uncertainty in Measurement published in 1993 by the International
	Organization for Standardization, ISO. This document describes current
	recommended practices in this area.) It is shown that although gradual
	and continuous progress has been made in the reporting of uncertainty
	information, comprehensive uncertainty analyses remain rare, particularly
	with regard to the consideration of contributions arising from sample
	impurities. Problems in the application of experimental property
	results to technological challenges are discussed within the broad
	context of inconsistencies in the expression of uncertainty. Widespread
	acceptance and application of the standard methods and terminologies
	established within the GUM are encouraged for the benefit of experimentalists,
	data evaluators, and data users alike.},

  abstract = {Canine aggression poses serious public health and animal welfare concerns.
	Most of what is understood about breed differences in aggression
	comes from reports based on bite statistics, behavior clinic caseloads,
	and experts' opinions. Information on breed-specific aggressiveness
	derived from such sources may be misleading due to biases attributable
	to a disproportionate risk of injury associated with larger and/or
	more physically powerful breeds and the existence of breed stereotypes.
	The present study surveyed the owners of more than 30 breeds of dogs
	using the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire
	(C-BARQ), a validated and reliable instrument for assessing dogs'
	typical and recent responses to a variety of common stimuli and situations.
	Two independent data samples (a random sample of breed club members
	and an online sample) yielded significant differences among breeds
	in aggression directed toward strangers, owners and dogs (Kruskal-Wallis
	tests, P�<�0.0001). Eight breeds common to both datasets (Dachshund,
	English Springer Spaniel, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever, Poodle,
	Rottweiler, Shetland Sheepdog and Siberian Husky) ranked similarly,
	rs�=�0.723, P�<�0.05; rs�=�0.929, P�<�0.001; rs�=�0.592, P�=�0.123,
	for aggression directed toward strangers, dogs and owners, respectively.
	Some breeds scored higher than average for aggression directed toward
	both humans and dogs (e.g., Chihuahuas and Dachshunds) while other
	breeds scored high only for specific targets (e.g., dog-directed
	aggression among Akitas and Pit Bull Terriers). In general, aggression
	was most severe when directed toward other dogs followed by unfamiliar
	people and household members. Breeds with the greatest percentage
	of dogs exhibiting serious aggression (bites or bite attempts) toward
	humans included Dachshunds, Chihuahuas and Jack Russell Terriers
	(toward strangers and owners); Australian Cattle Dogs (toward strangers);
	and American Cocker Spaniels and Beagles (toward owners). More than
	20% of Akitas, Jack Russell Terriers and Pit Bull Terriers were reported
	as displaying serious aggression toward unfamiliar dogs. Golden Retrievers,
	Labradors Retrievers, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Brittany Spaniels, Greyhounds
	and Whippets were the least aggressive toward both humans and dogs.
	Among English Springer Spaniels, conformation-bred dogs were more
	aggressive to humans and dogs than field-bred dogs (stranger aggression:
	Mann-Whitney U test, z�=�3.880, P�<�0.0001; owner aggression: z�=�2.110,
	P�<�0.05; dog-directed aggression: z�=�1.93, P�=�0.054), suggesting
	a genetic influence on the behavior. The opposite pattern was observed
	for owner-directed aggression among Labrador Retrievers, (z�=�2.18,
	P�<�0.05) indicating that higher levels of aggression are not attributable
	to breeding for show per se.},

	Metastable states N 2 ( A 3 Σ + u ), N ( 2 D ), and N ( 2 P ) are

	Temperature effects and the role of the kinetic energy content of
	reactants are investigated. In all cases, experimental uncertainties
	of laboratory data are reported or estimated. Recommended values
	with uncertainties, or estimated values when no data are available,
	are given for rate constants and product branching ratios at 300 K
	and at the atmospheric temperature range of Titan (150-200 K for
	neutral reactions and 150 K for ion reactions).},

	cross section was integrated to yield a thermal rate coefficient
	of 1.9 × 10-6 cm3 s-1. Product branching ratios were measured and
	proved to be quite complex. Although 16 channels are energetically
	accessible at 0 eV, it was not possible to assign branching ratios
	to all channels; some related channels were combined in the analysis.
	The results show that the dissociation channel corresponding to loss
	of a single hydrogen atom dominates, with a branching ratio of 0.42.
	Multiple H-loss channels are also observed. Product channels that
	involve breaking a C-C bond have a combined branching ratio ranging

	resident in the Milky Way, and by the Fermi Paradox, glibly stated
	as: . Both rely on using average values of key parameters, such as
	the mean signal lifetime of a communicating civilization. A more
	accurate answer must take into account the distribution of stellar,
	planetary and biological attributes in the galaxy, as well as the
	stochastic nature of evolution itself. This paper outlines a method
	of Monte Carlo realization that does this, and hence allows an estimation
	of the distribution of key parameters in SETI, as well as allowing
	a quantification of their errors (and the level of ignorance therein).
	Furthermore, it provides a means for competing theories of life and
	intelligence to be compared quantitatively. },

  abstract = {Because dissociative recombination (DR) reactions of molecular ions
	are often highly exothermic, in the thermospheres of the Earth and
	planets DR may be a source of translationally and internally excited
	fragments. DR is important, therefore, for thermospheric neutral
	heating; if the excited fragments radiate to space, however, DR may
	be also a source of thermospheric cooling. DR may produce metastable
	fragments, which may live long enough to participate in reactions
	that are not available to ground state species. It is rare, however,
	for DR to be a significant source of minor species in their ground
	states. An exception appears to be the DR of CO+2, which has recently
	been found to produce C + O2 about 9% of the time by Seiersen et
	al.. Because of the significant rearrangement of bonds that must
	take place, the branching ratio for the latter channel has been assumed
	to be negligible, and DR of CO+2 has been assumed to produce mainly
	CO + O. In order to test the effect of including the branching ratio
	of CO+2 DR that produces C + O2 on the ambient densities of thermal
	and escaping C in planetary thermospheres,we have we have constructed
	revised models of the thermospheres/ionospheres of Mars and Venus.
	Because of space limitations, we discuss here only the high solar
	activity models. For Mars, we find that DR of CO+2 is the most important
	source of thermal C, but that the production rate of escaping C is
	not increased. There are important differences between the thermospheres
	of Venus and Mars, and we find that the inclusion of the C + O2 channel
	in the Venus models increases the production rate of atomic carbon
	in the Venus thermosphere by only 10-16%. At high altitudes on Venus,
	C+ is mostly produced by photoionization and electron-impact ionization
	of C, with some contribution from the charge transfer reaction, O+
	+ C - C+ + O. We compare our computed C density altitude profiles
	to those inferred by Paxton from Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ultraviolet
	Spectrometer limb scans of the atomic carbon emission features at
	1561 and 1657 A. Since the most important loss process for C is reaction
	with O2, this allows us to to constrain the abundance of O2 in the
	Venus thermosphere. We then compute density profiles of C+ and compare
	them to those measured by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter Ion Mass Spectrometer
	(OIMS) (e.g., Taylor et al. [3]) to determine the rate coefficient
	for the charge transfer reaction of O+ to C.},

	the solar and electron energy deposition is used as an organizing

	secondary electron production rates with the rates inferred from
	suprathermal electron intensity measurements. We then calculate an
	effective electron dissociative recombination coefficient, applying
	three different approaches to the Cassini data set. Our findings
	are threefold: (1) The effective recombination coefficient derived
	under sunlit conditions in the deep ionosphere (&lt;1200 km) is found
	to be independent of solar zenith angle and flyby. Its value ranges
	from 6.9 × 10&#8722;7 cm3 s&#8722;1 at 1200 km to 5.9 × 10&#8722;6
	cm3 s&#8722;1 at 970 km at 500 K. (2) The presence of an additional,
	minor source of ionization is revealed when the solar contribution
	is weak enough. The contribution by this non-solar source&#8212;energetic
	electrons most probably of magnetospheric origin&#8212;becomes apparent
	for secondary electron production rates, due to solar illumination
	alone, close to or smaller than about 3 × 10&#8722;1 cm&#8722;3 s&#8722;1.
	Such a threshold is reached near the solar terminator below the main
	solar-driven electron production peak (&lt;1050 km). (3) Our ability
	to model the electron density in the deep ionosphere is very limited.
	Our findings highlight the need for more laboratory measurements
	of electron dissociative recombination coefficients for heavy ion
	species at high electron temperatures (especially near 500 K).},

	on the mole fraction of the species are small (never larger than

	(i) the Ly-α branching ratios of Wang et al. (Wang, J.H. et al. [2000].
	J. Chem. Phys. 113, 4146–4152) used in recent models overestimate
	the CH2:CH3 ratio, a factor to which a lot of species are sensitive;
	(ii) the description of out-of-Ly-α branching ratios by the “100%
	CH3” scenario has to be avoided, as it can bias significantly the
	mole fractions of some important species (C3H8); and (iii) complementary

  abstract = {Alcohols and nitriles not only play an important role as templates
	for synthesis of larger molecules in the interstellar medium and

	for biomolecules. Alcohols can form carbohydrates through reaction
	with HCO and nitriles can be hydrolysed to amino acids in aqueous
	solutions, which is the final step of the well-known Strecker synthesis.
	Therefore the question of the pathways of formation of alcohols and
	nitriles and the efficiency and the product distribution of their
	subsequent degradation reactions in the above-mentioned astrophysical
	environments is of great interest. In both processes dissociative
	recombination reactions of protonated nitriles and alcohols may play
	a major role and are included in models of interstellar clouds and
	planetary atmospheres. However, the reaction rate coefficients and
	product branching ratios for the majority of these processes are

  abstract = {The recombination of H+3 ions with electrons has been studied in afterglow
	plasma in three different experiments. In two experiments, using
	the Variable Temperature Stationary Afterglow (VT-AISA) and the Variable
	Temperature Flowing Afterglow (VT-FALP) techniques, a decay of the
	electron number density was measured by an electrostatic Langmuir
	probe to determine the recombination rate coefficient. In the third
	experiment a near infrared Cavity Ring-Down Absorption Spectrometer
	(CRDS) was used to monitor the decay of the H+3 (v = 0) ion density
	during the afterglow. Measurements were carried out in helium buffer
	gas with small admixtures of argon and hydrogen at total pressures
	ranging from 150 up to 1200 Pa and at buffer gas temperatures ranging
	from 100 up to 330 K. In the experiments the partial number density
	of hydrogen was varied from 5 x 1010 up to 1 x 1016 cm[?]3 and for
	this broad range of hydrogen number densities effective recombination
	rate coefficients were obtained, which varied over three orders of
	magnitude from 2 x 10[?]9 cm3s[?]1 at [H2] = 5 x 1010 cm[?]3 up to
	3 x 10[?]6 cm3s[?]1 at [H2] = 1 x 1016 cm[?]3. Using our experimental
	results we discuss possible mechanisms of recombination in hydrogen
	plasma in a very broad range of several parameters: buffer gas pressure,
	temperature, electron number density, hydrogen number density and
	internal excitation of recombining ions.},

	CH4 were measured from threshold to 1000 eV. Ion kinetic energy distributions
	were measured applying a deflection and retarding field method. The
	extraction of ions from the ion source was simulated fully three-dimensionally
	including the presence of a magnetic field for electron guidance.
	Thereby, discrimination factors were determined as a function of
	the initial ion kinetic energy. Multiplication of these factors with
	the ion signal leads to relative partial cross sections. By normalizing
	the sum of these partial cross sections to an absolute value taken
	from the literature, absolute partial cross sections were obtained
	that agree well with previous measurements where a complete collection
	of the product ions has been demonstrated. Moreover, with the present
	method, it is possible to determine cross sections that are differential
	with respect to the initial kinetic energy of the ion.},

	recombination of the ions CH2OH+, CD2OD+ and CD2OD2+ have been performed
	at the CRYRING storage ring located in Stockholm, Sweden. Evaluation
	of the data yielded reaction rate coefficients of: 7.0 times 10-7(T/300)-0.78
	cm3 mol-1 s-1 for CH2OH+; 7.5 times 10-7(T/300)-0.70 cm3 mol-1 s-1
	for CD2OD+ and 1.51 times 10-6(T/300)-0.66 cm3 mol-1 s-1 for CD2OD2+.
	Calculation of the branching ratios for CH2OH+ and its deuterated
	isotopologue gave the following results for the DR reaction channels
	involving C-O bond fissure: H2O + CH (2.2%) and CH2 + OH (5.5%) in
	the reaction of CH2OH+ as well as D2O + CD (5%) and CD2 + OD (18%)
	for the dissociative recombination of CD2OD+. The remainder of the
	reaction flux kept the C-O bond intact: 92% for CH2OH+ and 77% for
	CD2OD+, respectively. Other recent measurements on the CH3OH2+ ion
	indicate dominating bond breaking between the heavy atoms, which
	is in contrast to this experiment. For CD2OD2+ CO-bond breaking was
	observed for 43% of the reaction flux.

	in the abundance of stratospheric acetylene and ethane from Cassini/CIRS
	data in the southern hemisphere of Saturn. High resolution, 0.5 cm-1,
	CIRS data was used from three data sets taken in June-November 2004
	and binned into 2° wide latitudinal strips to increase the signal-to-noise
	ratio. Tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were initially
	retrieved to determine the temperature profile for each latitude
	bin. The stratospheric temperature at 2 mbar increased by 14 K from
	9° to 68° S, including a steep 4 K rise between 60° and 68° S. The
	tropospheric temperatures showed significantly more meridional variation
	than the stratospheric ones, the locations of which are strongly
	correlated to that of the zonal jets. Stratospheric acetylene abundance
	decreases steadily from 30 to 68° S, by a factor of 1.8 at 2.0 mbar.
	Between 18° and 30° S the acetylene abundance increases at 2.0 mbar.
	Global values for acetylene have been calculated as (1.9±0.19)×10-7
	at 2.0 mbar, (2.6±0.27)×10-7 at 1.6 mbar and (3.1±0.32)×10-7 at 1.4
	mbar. Global values for ethane are also determined and found to be
	(1.6±0.25)×10-5 at 0.5 mbar and (1.4±0.19)×10-5 at 1.0 mbar. Ethane
	abundance in the stratosphere increases towards the south pole by
	a factor of 2.5 at 2.0 mbar. The increase in stratospheric ethane
	is especially pronounced polewards of 60° S at 2.0 mbar. The increase
	of stratospheric ethane towards the south pole supports the presence
	of a meridional wind system in the stratosphere of Saturn.},

  abstract = {This study evaluated the suitability of some disinfection and sterilization
	methods for use with microdialysis probes. Disinfection or sterilization
	should minimize the tissue inflammatory reaction and improve the
	long-term health of rats on study and ensure the quality of data
	obtained by microdialysis sampling. Furthermore, the treatment should
	not negatively impact probe integrity or sampling performance. The
	techniques chosen for evaluation included two disinfection methods
	(70% ethanol and a commercial contact lens solution) and two sterilization
	methods (hydrogen peroxide plasma, and e-beam radiation). Linear
	microdialysis probes treated by these processes were compared to
	untreated probes removed from the manufacturer's packaging as if
	sterile (the control group). The probes were aseptically implanted
	in the livers of rats and monitored for 72 hours. The parameters
	chosen to evaluate probe performance were relative sample mass recovery
	and the relative in vivo extraction efficiency of the probe for caffeine.
	Post mortem bacterial counts and histopathology examination of liver
	tissue were also conducted. The probes remained intact and functional
	for the entire study period. The methods tested did not acutely alter
	the probes although hydrogen peroxide plasma and contact lens solution
	groups showed reduced extraction efficiencies. Minimal tissue damage
	was observed surrounding the probes and acute inflammatory reaction
	was mild to moderate. Low numbers of bacterial colonies from the
	implantation sites indicates that the health of animals in this study
	was not impaired. This was also true for the control group (untreated
	probe).},

  abstract = {The existence of a broad, mid-infrared absorption ranging from 1000
	to 3000 cm$^{-1}$ is usually interpreted as a signature for the existence
	of protonated water networks. Herein, we use cryogenic mixtures of
	water and hydrogen fluoride (HF) and show experimental and computational
	evidence that similarly wide absorptions can be generated by a broad
	distribution of proton-shared and ion pair complexes. In the present
	case, we demonstrate that the broadening is mainly inhomogeneous,
	reflecting the fact that the topology of the first solvation shell
	determines the local degree of ionization and the shared-proton asymmetric
	stretching frequency within H2O·HF complexes. The extreme sensitivity
	of the proton transfer potential energy hypersurface to local hydrogen
	bonding topologies modulates its vibrational frequency from 2800
	down to $\sim$ 1300 cm$^{-1}$, the latter value being characteristic
	of solvation geometries that yield similar condensed-phase proton
	affinities for H2O and fluoride. By linking the local degree of ionization
	to the solvation pattern, we are able to propose a mechanism of ionization
	for HF in aqueous solutions and to explain some of their unusual
	properties at large concentrations. However, an important conclusion
	of broad scientific interest is our prediction that spectral signatures
	that are normally attributed to protonated water networks could also
	reveal the presence of strong hydrogen bonds between un-ionized acids
	and water molecules, with important consequences to spectroscopic
	investigations of biologically relevant proton channels and pumps.},

  abstract = {We have developed a one-dimensional photochemical model to study both
	the composition and density structure of Titan's ionosphere. The
	model neutral atmosphere developed by Yung et al. (1984) and Yung
	(1987) was used as a basis to model the chemistry of Titan's ionosphere.
	Ionization rates due both to photoionization by solar EUV flux and
	to electron impact ionization by photoelectrons and Saturnian magnetospheric
	electrons were included. The major neutral species (nitrogen and
	methane) are ionized to produce N$_2^+$, N$^+$, CH$_4^+$, CH$_3^+$,
	CH$_2^+$, and CH$^+$ ions. Ion-neutral chemistry converts these ions
	to the major ion species H$_2$CN$^+$ (in agreement with Atreya (1986),
	Strobel (1985), and Ip (1990a)), as well as C$_2$H$_5^+$, CH$_5^+$,
	HCN$^+$, and more complex hydrocarbon ions (C$_n$H$_m^+$). Inclusion
	of both forms of ionization gave a peak electron density of ≈ 3030
	cm$$^{−3}$ at an altitude of ≈ 1175 km along the terminator. The
	radio occultation experiment on board Voyager 1 (Lindal et al., 1983)
	put limits on the maximum ionospheric electron density of 5 × 10$^3$
	cm$^{−3}$ and 3 × 10$^3$ cm$^{−3}$ along the morning and evening
	terminators, respectively. The total external pressure (i.e., dynamic,
	thermal, and magnetic) upstream of Titan at the time of the Voyager
	encounter is of the order of the maximum ionospheric thermal pressure.
	As a consequence one can expect that the solar wind interaction with
	Venus during periods of high solar wind dynamic pressure might provide
	a good analogy for the interaction of Titan with the Saturnian magnetospheric
	plasma.}

  abstract = {Copulas have attracted significant attention in the recent literature
	for modeling multivariate observations. An important feature of copulas
	is that they enable us to specify the univariate marginal distributions
	and their joint behavior separately. The copula parameter captures
	the intrinsic dependence between the marginal variables and it can
	be estimated by parametric or semiparametric methods. For practical
	applications, the so called inference function for margins (IFM)
	method has emerged as the preferred fully parametric method because
	it is close to maximum likelihood (ML) in approach and is easier
	to implement. The purpose of this paper is to compare the ML and
	IFM methods with a semiparametric (SP) method that treats the univariate
	marginal distributions as unknown functions. In this paper, we consider
	the SP method proposed by Genest et al. [1995. A semiparametric estimation
	procedure of dependence parameters in multivariate families of distributions.
	Biometrika 82(3), 543-552], which has attracted considerable interest
	in the literature. The results of an extensive simulation study reported
	here show that the ML/IFM methods are nonrobust against misspecification
	of the marginal distributions, and that the SP method performs better
	than the ML and IFM methods, overall. A data example on household
	expenditure is used to illustrate the application of various data
	analytic methods for applying the SP method, and to compare and contrast
	the ML, IFM and SP methods. The main conclusion is that, in terms
	of statistical computations and data analysis, the SP method is better
	than ML and IFM methods when the marginal distributions are unknown
	which is almost always the case in practice.},

  abstract = {The last century saw the application of Boolean algebra to the construction
	of computing machines, which work by applying logical transformations
	to information contained in their memory. The development of information
	theory and the generalization of Boolean algebra to Bayesian inference
	have enabled these computing machines, in the last quarter of the
	twentieth century, to be endowed with the ability to learn by making
	inferences from data. This revolution is just beginning as new computational
	techniques continue to make difficult problems more accessible. Recent
	advances in our understanding of the foundations of probability theory
	have revealed implications for areas other than logic. Of relevance
	to intelligent machines, we recently identified the algebra of questions
	as the free distributive algebra, which will now allow us to work
	with questions in a way analogous to that which Boolean algebra enables
	us to work with logical statements. In this paper, we examine the
	foundations of inference and inquiry. We begin with a history of
	inferential reasoning, highlighting key concepts that have led to
	the automation of inference in modern machineâlearning systems.
	We then discuss the foundations of inference in more detail using
	a modern viewpoint that relies on the mathematics of partially ordered
	sets and the scaffolding of lattice theory. This new viewpoint allows
	us to develop the logic of inquiry and introduce a measure describing
	the relevance of a proposed question to an unresolved issue. Last,
	we will demonstrate the automation of inference, and discuss how
	this new logic of inquiry will enable intelligent machines to ask
	questions. Automation of both inference and inquiry promises to allow
	robots to perform science in the far reaches of our solar system
	and in other star systems by enabling them not only to make inferences
	from data, but also to decide which question to ask, which experiment
	to perform, or which measurement to take given what they have learned
	and what they are designed to understand.},

  abstract = {A global-mean model of coupled neutral and ion chemistry on Titan
	has been developed. Unlike the previous coupled models, the model
	involves ambipolar diffusion and escape of ions, hydrodynamic escape
	of light species, and calculates the H2 and CO densities near the
	surface that were assigned in some previous models. We tried to reduce
	the numbers of species and reactions in the model and remove all
	species and reactions that weakly affect the observed species. Hydrocarbon
	chemistry is extended to C12H10 for neutrals and C10H+11 for ions
	but does not include PAHs. The model involves 415 reactions of 83
	neutrals and 33 ions, effects of magnetospheric electrons, protons,
	and cosmic rays. UV absorption by Titan's haze was calculated using
	the Huygens observations and a code for the aggregate particles.
	Hydrocarbon, nitrile, and ion chemistries are strongly coupled on
	Titan, and attempt to calculate them separately (e.g., in models
	of ionospheric composition) may result in significant error. The
	model densities of various species are typically in good agreement
	with the observations except vertical profiles in the stratosphere
	that are steeper than the CIRS limb data. (A model with eddy diffusion
	that facilitates fitting to the CIRS limb data is considered as well.)
	The CO densities are supported by the O+ flux from Saturn's magnetosphere.
	The ionosphere includes a peak at 80 km formed by the cosmic rays,
	steplike layers at 500-700 and 700-900 km and a peak at 1060 km (SZA
	= 60°). Nighttime densities of major ions agree with the INMS data.
	Ion chemistry dominates in the production of bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
	above 600 km. The model estimates of heavy positive and negative
	ions are in reasonable agreement with the Cassini results. The major
	haze production is in the reactions C6H + C4H2, C3N + C4H2, and condensation
	of hydrocarbons below 100 km. Overall, precipitation rate of the
	photochemical products is equal to 4-7 kg[thin space]cm-2[thin space]Byr-1
	(50-90 m[thin space]Byr-1 while the global-mean depth of the organic
	sediments is ~3 m). Escape rates of methane and hydrogen are 2.9
	and 1.4 kg[thin space]cm-2[thin space]Byr-1, respectively. The model
	does not support the low C/N ratio observed by the Huygens ACP in
	Titan's haze.},

  abstract = {Previous modeling by Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000a,b) showed that the
	CH4 thermospheric mixing ratio on Titan could vary as much as 35-40%
	due to ion-neutral chemical reactions. A new vertical methane profile
	has been computed by simultaneously modifying the stratospheric methane
	mixing ratio and the K(z) previously considered by Lara et al. (1996)
	and Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000a,b). A satisfactory fit of the methane
	thermospheric abundance and stratospheric mixing ratio of other minor
	constituents is achieved by placing the homopause at ~1000 km and
	increasing the methane stratospheric mixing ratio (qCH4) up to 3.8%.
	The new proposed eddy diffusion coefficient steadily rises from 1×107
	cm2 s-1 at 700 km to 1×1010 cm2 s-1 at 1500 km, whereas the stratospheric
	values are in the range (4-20)×103 cm2 s-1. Other likely ionization
	sources that can influence the methane distribution are (i) a metallic
	ion layer produced by micrometeoroid infall and (ii) frequent X-rays
	solar flares. Analysis of the effects of these ionization sources
	on the methane distribution indicates that, unlike previously assumed,
	CH4 can suffer considerable variations. These variations, although
	proved in this work, must be cautiously regarded since several assumptions
	have to be made on the rate of N2 and CH4 ionization by the processes
	previously mentioned. Hence, these results are only indicative of
	methane sensitivity to ionospheric chemistry.},

	The main purpose of this model is to help in the understanding of
	the missing link between the gas production and particle transformation

	model described in Part I is applied to the study of Titan's atmospheric
	processes that lead to haze formation. Our model generates the haze
	structure from the gaseous species photochemistry. Model results
	are presented for the species vertical concentration profiles, haze
	formation and its radiative properties, vertical temperature/density
	profiles and geometric albedo. These are validated against Cassini/Huygens
	observations and other ground-based and space-borne measurements.
	The model reproduces well most of the latest measurements from the
	Cassini/Huygens instruments for the chemical composition of Titan's
	atmosphere and the vertical profiles of the observed species. For
	the haze production we have included pathways that are based on pure
	hydrocarbons, pure nitriles and hydrocarbon/nitrile copolymers. From
	these, the nitrile and copolymer pathways provide the stronger contribution,
	in agreement with the results from the ACP instrument, which support
	the incorporation of nitrogen in the pyrolized haze structures. Our
	haze model reveals a new second major peak in the vertical profile
	of haze production rate between 500 and 900 km. This peak is produced
	by the copolymer family used and has important ramifications for
	the vertical atmospheric temperature profile and geometric albedo.
	In particular, the existence of this second peak determines the vertical
	profile of haze extinction. Our model results have been compared
	with the DISR retrieved haze extinction profiles and are found to
	be in very good agreement. We have also incorporated in our model
	heterogeneous chemistry on the haze particles that converts atomic
	hydrogen to molecular hydrogen. The resultant H2 profile is closer
	to the INMS measurements, while the vertical profile of the diacetylene
	formed is found to be closer to that of the CIRS profile when this
	heterogenous chemistry is included.},

  abstract = {Benzene has recently been observed in the atmosphere of Jupiter, Saturn
	and also Titan. This compound is required as a precursor for larger
	aromatic species (PAHs) that may be part of aerosol particles. Several
	photochemical models have tried to reproduce the observed quantities
	of benzene in the atmospheres of Jupiter (both low- and high-latitudes
	regions), Saturn and Titan. In this present work, we have conducted
	a sensitivity study of benzene and PAHs formation, using similar
	photochemical schemes both for Titan and Jupiter (low-latitudes conditions).
	Two different photochemical schemes are used, for which the modeled
	composition fairly agrees with observational constraints, both for
	Jupiter and Titan. Some disagreements are specific to each atmospheric
	case, which may point to needed improvements, especially in kinetic
	data involved in the corresponding chemical cycles. The observed
	benzene mole fraction in Titan's stratosphere is reproduced by the
	model, but in the case of Jupiter, low-latitudes benzene abundance
	is only 3% of the observed column density, which may indicate a possible
	influence of latitudinal transport, since abundance of benzene is
	much higher in auroral regions. Though, the photochemical scheme
	of C6 compounds at temperature and pressure conditions of planetary
	atmospheres is still very uncertain. Several variations are therefore
	done on key reactions in benzene production. These variations show
	that benzene abundance is mainly sensitive to reactions that may
	affect the propargyl radical. The effect of aerosol production on
	hydrocarbons composition is also tested, as well as possible heterogenous
	recombination of atomic hydrogen in the case of Titan. PAHs are a
	major pathway for aerosol production in both models. The mass production
	profiles for aerosols are discussed for both Titan and Jupiter. Total
	production mass fluxes are roughly three times the one expected by
	observational constraints in both cases. Such comparative studies
	are useful to bring more constraints on photochemical models.},

  abstract = {Using a one-dimensional model, we investigate the hydrogen budget
	and escape to space in Titan's atmosphere. Our goal is to study in
	detail the distributions and fluxes of atomic and molecular hydrogen
	in the model, while identifying sources of qualitative and quantitative
	uncertainties. Our study confirms that the escape of atomic and molecular
	hydrogen to space is limited by the diffusion through the homopause
	level. The H distribution and flux inside the atmosphere are very
	sensitive to the eddy diffusion coefficient used above altitude 600
	km. We chose a high value of this coefficient 1 × 108 cm2 s-1 and
	a homopause level around altitude 900 km. We find that H flows down
	significantly from the production region above 500 km to the region
	[300-500] km, where it recombines into H2. Production of both H and
	H2 also occurs in the stratosphere, mostly from photodissociation
	of acetylene. The only available observational data to be compared
	are the escape rate of H deduced from Pioneer 11 and IUE observations
	of the H torus 1-3 × 109 cm-2 s-1 and the latest retrieved value
	of the H2 mole fraction in the stratosphere: (1.1 ± 0.1) × 10-3.
	Our results for both of these values are at least 50-100% higher,
	though the uncertainties within the chemical schemes and other aspects
	of the model are large. The chemical conversion from H to H2 is essentially
	done through catalytic cycles using acetylene and diacetylene. We
	have studied the role of this diacetylene cycle, for which the associated
	reaction rates are poorly known. We find that it mostly affects C4
	species and benzene in the lower atmosphere, rather than the H profile
	and the hydrogen budget. We have introduced the heterogenous recombination
	of hydrogen on the surface of aerosol particles in the stratosphere,
	and this appears to be a significant process, comparable to the chemical
	processes. It has a major influence on the H distribution, and consequently
	on several other species, especially C3H4, C4H2 and C6H6. Therefore,
	this heterogenous process should be taken into account when trying
	to understand the stratospheric distribution of these hydrocarbons.},

	Using information available from these experiments, we suggest chemical

	will be the precursors to aerosol particles: polymers of acetylene
	and cyanoacetylene, polycyclic aromatics, polymers of HCN and other
	nitriles, and polyynes. Although our goal here is not to build a
	detailed kinetic model for this transition, we propose parameterizations
	to estimate the production rates of these macromolecules, their C/N
	and C/H ratios, and the loss of parent molecules (C2H2, HCN, HC3N
	and other nitriles, and C6H6) from the gas phase to the haze. We
	use a one-dimensional photochemical model of Titan's atmosphere to
	estimate the formation rate of precursor macromolecules. We find

	To do this, we conduct a detailed analysis of ground and in-flight

	and the mass of the ions is within the measurement range of the INMS

	ratio in N2, the time scale for the outgassing of methane from the
	interior, and the initial D/H ratio in methane. Over geologic time
	scales, the isotopes are fractionated by diffusion, atmospheric escape
	and photochemistry. Diffusion and escape preferentially remove the
	lighter isotopes for all constituents. Photolysis of methane also
	removes the lighter isotopes, while photolysis of nitrogen preferentially
	removes the heavier isotopes. We have found the following: (1) even
	taking past hydrodynamic escape into consideration, the initial 14N/15N
	ratio in N2 cannot have changed much from its current value as the
	result of atmospheric processes. This is due to the large amount
	of N2 that must be fractionated. High-rate loss processes, such as
	hydrodynamic escape, are inefficient fractionators and take a very
	long time to change the isotopic ratio. On the other hand, low-rate
	loss processes are efficient fractionators, but also take a very
	long time to influence a large inventory. (2) The current inventory
	of methane represents the remnant of methane that, constrained by
	the 12C/13C ratio, began outgassing from the interior more than 60
	million years ago, resulting in a total inventory of 3–4 times the
	current inventory cycling through the system during this time period.
	Methane production is likely to be ongoing. (3) The initial D/H in
	methane was found to be 6.96–11.3×10−5.},

	methane began outgassing from the interior, assuming that outgassing
	of methane (e.g., cryovolcanic activity) has been continuous ever
	since. We find that three factors play a crucial role in this timescale:
	(1) the escape rate of methane, (2) the difference between the current
	and initial ratios and the rate of methane, and (3) production or
	resupply due to cryovolcanic activity. We estimate an upper limit

	at a distance of about 10 times the radius of the visible rings.
	This torus may be detectable from Earth-orbit and detection of nondetection
	of it may provide some information about the presence or absence
	of a Saturnian magnetic field, and the exospheric temperature and
	atmospheric escape rate of Titan. It is estimated that, if Titan
	has a large exosphere, ~97% or more of the escaping atoms can be
	recaptured by Titan, thereby decreasing the effective net atmospheric
	loss rate by up to two orders of magnitude. With such a reduction
	in atmospheric loss rates, it becomes more plausible to suggest that
	satellites previously thought too small to retain an atmosphere may
	have one. It is suggested that Saturn be examined by Lyman-[alpha]
	and other observations to search for the gaseous torus of Titan.
	If successful, these could then be extended to other satellites.
	The effect of a hypothetical Saturnian magnetosphere on the atmosphere
	of Titan is investigated. It is shown that, if Saturn has a magnetic
	field comparable to Jupiter's (~10 G at the planetary surface), the
	magnetospheric plasma can supply Titan with hydrogen at a rate comparable
	to the loss rates in some of the models of [Trafton, 1972] and [Sagan,
	1973]. A major part of the Saturnian ionospheric escape flux (~ 1027
	photoelectrons sec-1) could perhaps be captured by Titan. At the
	upper limit, this rate of hydrogen input to the satellite could total
	~0.1 atm pressure over the lifetime of the solar system, an amount
	comparable to estimates of the present atmospheric pressure of Titan.},

	investigate the formation of hitherto undetected C2N isomers in the

	calculations expose that the reaction has no entrance barrier and
	proceeds on the triplet surface via addition of the carbon atom to
	the p-bond, yielding a cyclic HC2N intermediate. This complex either
	decomposes to cyclic C2N plus atomic hydrogen or rearranges via ring
	opening to the HCNC or HCCN isomers. These molecules can fragment
	via atomic hydrogen ejection to the linear CCN (2P) and CNC (2Pg)
	radicals. The formation of all three C2N isomers proceeds without
	any exit barrier, but the reactions to form CNC, CCN, and c-C2N are
	found to be strongly endothermic by 52.7, 59.0, and 99.6 kJ mol-1,
	respectively. Based on these investigations, the neutral-neutral
	reaction of atomic carbon with hydrogen cyanide cannot synthesize
	C2N isomers in cold molecular clouds, where average translation temperatures
	of the reactants are only 10-15 K. However, the physical conditions
	in circumstellar envelopes of, for example, IRC+10216, differ strongly;
	close to the photosphere of the central star, temperatures can reach
	4000 K, and the elevated velocity of both reactants in the long tail
	of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution can overcome the reaction endothermicity
	to form at least the linear CNC and CCN isomers. Therefore, these
	environments represent ideal targets to search for hitherto undetected

  abstract = {This paper is concerned with the chemical evolution of large molecules
	in interstellar clouds. We consider the chemistry and ionisation
	balance of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) type molecules
	in diffuse clouds and show that certain PAH molecules can be doubly
	ionised by the interstellar ultraviolet radiation field. If recombination
	of the dications so produced with electrons is dissociative rather
	than radiative, then PAHs are rapidly destroyed. PAHs which can only
	be singly ionised have much smaller recombination energies and can
	be long lasting in these regions. This type of property may be very
	important in selecting the PAH species which can populate the general
	interstellar medium and account for certain of the diffuse bands
	observed in optical spectra. Destruction of PAH molecules via formation
	of dications may be responsible for the weakening of the diffuse
	bands observed in regions of high UV flux. We also discuss the chemistry
	of large, saturated molecules in hot molecular cores in star-forming
	regions. Here it appears that gas phase abundances are determined
	by surface chemistry on the cold ice mantles of interstellar grains.
	We present the preliminary results of a study of deuterium chemistry
	in these hot cores with the aim of probing both the detailed surface
	processes by which complex molecules are synthesised and the gas
	phase reactions which destroy them.},

  abstract = {Dissociative electron-ion recombination (DR) is an important ionization
	loss process and source of neutral reactive radicals in the interstellar
	medium (ISM) and many other molecular plasmas. Unfortunately, neutral
	products are difficult to identify with only about 40 distributions
	being reported in the literature. These have been obtained by spectroscopic
	techniques integrated with flowing afterglows (FA) and using storage
	rings (SR). The data obtained by SR measurements are more extensive
	than those determined in the FA. Some data are available where the
	two techniques overlap, however here there are very significant differences.
	To resolve these contradictions, a new technique to quantitatively
	detect product neutrals has been developed. This technique is based
	on the FA and uses an electron impact (EI) ionizer to ionize the
	neutral products prior to detection by a quadrupole mass filter/electron
	multiplier. Two experimental methodologies, both using pulsed gas
	techniques, isolate and quantify the DR products. In one approach,
	an electron attaching gas is pulsed into the flow to transiently
	destroy electrons and thus quench DR. N2H+ recombination has been
	used as a test case and results from this approach give an upper
	limit of 5% for the NH + N product channel, the remainder being N2 + H.
	In the second approach, the reagent gas N2 is pulsed. Here the absolute

	Results from this approach also give an upper limit of 5% for NH + N
	production. This establishes that N2 + H is the dominant channel,
	being at least 95%, and that there is no significant NH production.
	This was contrary to a recent storage ring measurement which yielded
	64% NH + N and 36% N2 + H. Note, that these values have changed due
	to a recent re-measurement of the DR revealing that the NH channel
	is not nearly as significant as originally thought. Additionally,
	the DR product distribution for CH5+ is reported and discussed.},

	with solar photons, allows cosmic rays to penetrate deep into the

	an ionosphere with an electron density peak, placed at around 90 km,
	similar in magnitude to the ionospheric peak produced by solar radiation
	in the upper atmosphere. In the lower atmosphere, the electron density
	profile, in the absence of a magnetic field, depends mainly on the
	modulation of cosmic rays by the solar wind and on the nature of
	the ionizable particles. We present here the first results of a new
	numerical model developed to calculate the concentration of electrons
	and most abundant ions in the Titan lower atmosphere. The present
	knowledge of Titan's atmosphere permits us to include new neutral
	and ionic species, such as oxygen derivates, in a more detailed ion-chemistry
	calculation than previous lower ionospheric models of Titan. The
	electron density peaks at 90 km with a magnitude of 2150 cm-3. The

	cations are the most abundant ions below and above the electron density
	peak, respectively. We also discuss the effect of solar activity
	at the distance of the Saturn orbit on the spectrum of the cosmic
	particles. We obtain that from solar minimum to solar maximum the
	ionization rate at the energy deposition peak changes by a factor
	of 1.2 at 70 km, and by a factor of 2.6 at altitudes as high as 400 km.

  abstract = {This study reports on the development and testing of a method of quantifying
	the uncertainties in concentration predictions by a complex photochemical
	grid model (PGM), using a modification of the basic Monte Carlo method
	(MCM). The computationally intensive aspects of applying a full MCM
	to hundreds of PGM inputs and model parameters is replaced by a highly
	restricted sampling approach that exploits the spatial persistence
	found in predicted concentration fields. The sampling approach to
	the MCM is being explored as an efficient approach to assess the
	uncertainty in the differences in predicted maximum ozone concentration
	between base case and control scenarios. The MCM is applied to several
	dozen surface cells, with the goal of sampling the spatial pattern
	of uncertainty in the PGM-predicted differences in surface ozone
	concentration fields between a pair of base and control scenarios.
	The uncertainty in model inputs and parameters is simulated using
	several types of stochastic models. These stochastic models are driven
	using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to generate a non-redundant
	ensemble of alternative model inputs. Preliminary testing of the
	sampled MCM approach was conducted using the UAM-IV PGM on the New
	York ozone attainment modeling domain for the 6-8 July 1988 ozone
	episode. One hundred alternative concentration estimates were generated
	for a base scenario and for control scenarios representing 50%, 10%
	and 5% reduction of NOx emissions. The upper and lower bounds of
	the concentration difference ensemble that define a 95% confidence
	range were spatially interpolated from 27 monitoring sites to the
	full (surface) modeling domain, using the field of zero uncertainty
	(ZU) concentration differences. For the 50% NOx control scenario,
	predicted increases in peak ozone concentration smaller than 20 ppb
	were generally not significant from zero. By contrast, predicted
	decreases in peak ozone greater than 10 ppb were usually significant.
	For a control scenario with a small 5% NOx reduction, predicted concentration
	differences and confidence intervals were much smaller, but predicted
	changes in peak ozone were significant at a number of sample cells.},

	continua, which have been heretofore considered as separate processes

	of self-consistency between the rates for the inverse processes of
	photoionization and recombination, ensured by describing all atomic
	processes with an identical set of eigenfunction expansion within
	the close-coupling approximation using the $\mathstrut{{\bmi R}}$-matrix
	method. Photoionization cross sections and total electron-ion recombination

	expansions than those in the Opacity Project. In addition to the

  abstract = {The existence of methane in Titan's atmosphere (~6% level at the surface)
	presents a unique enigma, as photochemical models predict that the
	current inventory will be entirely depleted by photochemistry in
	a timescale of ~20 Myr. In this paper, we examine the clues available
	from isotopic ratios ( 12 C/ 13 C and D/H) in Titan's methane as
	to the past atmosphere history of this species. We first analyze
	recent infrared spectra of CH 4 collected by the Cassini Composite
	Infrared Spectrometer, measuring simultaneously for the first time
	the abundances of all three detected minor isotopologues: 13 CH 4
	, 12 CH 3 D, and 13 CH 3 D. From these we compute estimates of 12
	C/ 13 C = 86.5 ± 8.2 and D/H = (1.59 ± 0.33) × 10 –4 , in agreement
	with recent results from the Huygens GCMS and Cassini INMS instruments.
	We also use the transition state theory to estimate the fractionation
	that occurs in carbon and hydrogen during a critical reaction that
	plays a key role in the chemical depletion of Titan's methane: CH
	4 + C 2 H → CH 3 + C 2 H 2 . Using these new measurements and predictions
	we proceed to model the time evolution of 12 C/ 13 C and D/H in Titan's
	methane under several prototypical replenishment scenarios. In our
	Model 1 (no resupply of CH 4 ), we find that the present-day 12 C/
	13 C implies that the CH 4 entered the atmosphere 60-1600 Myr ago
	if methane is depleted by chemistry and photolysis alone, but much
	more recently—most likely less than 10 Myr ago—if hydrodynamic escape
	is also occurring. On the other hand, if methane has been continuously
	supplied at the replenishment rate then the isotopic ratios provide
	no constraints, and likewise for the case where atmospheric methane
	is increasing. We conclude by discussing how these findings may be
	combined with other evidence to constrain the overall history of
	the atmospheric methane.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present a method of nesting Dirichlet distributions,
	which ultimately gen-
	
	eralizes the Generalized Dirichlet distribution. We denote the resulting
	underlying distribution
	
	a nested Dirichlet distribution. We begin by providing some basic
	intuition for understanding
	
	the distribution as well as presenting some useful notation, the joint
	probability distribution
	
	function, and formulae for several properties of the distribution,
	such as the covariance matrix
	
	for all variables. We also discuss the close relationship of the distribution
	with the Generalized
	
	Dirichlet, show how to ¯t the distribution given multinomial data
	using Maximum Likelihood
	
	Estimators, and present an analysis of the accuracy and bias of these
	estimators using Cramer-
	
	Rao bounds.
	
	Subsequently we evaluate a data mining method to estimate the nesting
	structure of this
	
	distribution using simulated multinomial data. In our example, this
	method generally discovers
	
	the correct nesting structure. Further, forecasting using this ¯tted
	distribution (given data
	
	simulated from a nested Dirichlet underlying distribution) improve
	predictive power over the
	
	Dirichlet twice as much as the Generalized Dirichlet does.},

	65°C. With a well-designed cycle, it leaves residues of formaldehyde
	on sterilized items below 5 [mu]g/cm2, measured on a standard filter
	paper. Formaldehyde levels in air near the autoclave are well below
	official exposure limits, if at all measurable. Occurrence of late
	growers in bioindicators, and penetration of the sterilizing media
	into long narrow lumina, should be validated for new processes. Automated
	cleaning and disinfection in closed washer-disinfectors and flushing
	disinfectors are likewise processes relatively little known in the
	United States. Disinfection is achieved by a final rinse with hot
	water or steam. Washer-disinfectors are used for surgical instruments,
	nondisposable anesthesia and other equipment, flushing disinfectors
	for nondisposable bedpans, washbowls, urinals, and similar equipment.
	They clean well, washer-disinfectors excellently so, and disinfect
	reliably. With the use of such equipment in wards, surgical departments,
	and other areas, reliance on chemical germicides can be dramatically
	reduced and disposables can be replaced by disinfectable nondisposables.},

  abstract = {The Dirichlet family owes its privileged status within simplex distributions
	to easyness of interpretation and good mathematical properties. In
	particular, we recall fundamental properties for the analysis of
	compositional data such as closure under amalgamation and subcomposition.
	From a probabilistic point of view, it is characterised (uniquely)
	by a variety of independence relationships which makes it indisputably
	the reference model for expressing the non trivial idea of substantial
	independence for compositions. Indeed, its well known inadequacy
	as a general model for compositional data stems from such an independence
	structure together with the poorness of its parametrisation. In this
	paper a new class of distributions (called Flexible Dirichlet) capable
	of handling various dependence structures and containing the Dirichlet
	as a special case is presented. The new model exhibits a considerably
	richer parametrisation which, for example, allows to model the means
	and (part of) the variance-covariance matrix separately. Moreover,
	such a model preserves some good mathematical properties of the Dirichlet,
	i.e. closure under amalgamation and subcomposition with new parameters
	simply related to the parent composition parameters. Furthermore,
	the joint and conditional distributions of subcompositions and relative
	totals can be expressed as simple mixtures of two Flexible Dirichlet
	distributions. The basis generating the Flexible Dirichlet, though
	keeping compositional invariance, shows a dependence structure which
	allows various forms of partitional dependence to be contemplated
	by the model (e.g. non-neutrality, subcompositional dependence and
	subcompositional non-invariance), independence cases being identified
	by suitable parameter configurations. In particular, within this
	model substantial independence among subsets of components of the
	composition naturally occurs when the subsets have a Dirichlet distribution.},

	is an important process in the chemistry of interstellar clouds.
	Motivated by the evidence that HCN and its metastable isomer HNC
	are both formed via the dissociative recombination reaction of HCNH+,
	we have examined the potential energy surface for the dissociation
	of the transient HC3NH following the recombination between HC3NH+
	and electrons. We find that HC3NH+ gains 151 kcal mol-1 energy by
	the neutralization; this energy is high enough to isomerize HC3NH
	to HCCNCH, as well as to dissociate a hydrogen atom from either end
	of the molecule. The present calculation suggests, therefore, that
	the metastable linear and near-linear isomers of HC3N, namely, HNC3,
	HCCNC, and HCNCC, can be formed via the dissociative recombination
	between HC3NH+ and electrons. Two of these isomers, HNC3 and HCCNC,
	have already been detected in the dark cloud TMC-1. The unobserved
	species HCNCC is energetically the least stable. Since interstellar
	HC3N molecules are synthesized predominantly via neutral-neutral
	reactions, the HC3NH+ + e- process serves mainly to produce the metastable
	isomers of HC3N. We have incorporated these reaction products, as
	well as other relevant ion-molecule and neutral-neutral reactions,
	into our new standard model of dense interstellar clouds. Our model
	results show that the observed abundances in TMC-1 of HC3N, its two
	detected metastable isomers, and the related species C3H, C3N, and
	HC3NH+ can, in the main, be reproduced.},

	Methods: Several flow cytometric histograms derived from cell surface
	immunophenotyping for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1)
	on K562 cells were analyzed using numerical modeling. The prediction
	intervals derived from the modeling were used for decision making.
	Results: The residuals after peak fitting flow cytometric data are
	normally distributed and this permits the use of the prediction limit
	methodology. The usefulness of the approach for analyzing flow cytometry
	histograms is examined and the method is shown to avoid the "sensitivity"
	disadvantages associated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Conclusions:
	The prediction limit method is a viable alternative to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
	method.},

	products. Using the ion abundances of C. N. Keller et al. (1998,
	Planet. Space Sci.46, 1157-1174) and of M. Banaszkiewicz et al. (2000,
	Icarus147, 386-404), we find that the most important loss processes
	are the reactions with CH3 and with other unidentified radicals.
	According to our calculations, the HNC concentration reaches a peak
	of 104-105 molecules per cubic centimeter at an altitude of 1000-1100
	km (i.e., close to the ionospheric peak), but is very much reduced
	at lower altitudes. We find also that the HNC/HCN ratio in Titan's
	atmosphere may approach unity at the ionization peak altitude and
	above. We discuss prospects for the detection of HNC, or its reaction
	products, during the Cassini mission.},

	(DR) of molecular ions with electrons in the ionosphere of Titan

	on the ion densities measured by the INMS instrument on Cassini orbiter

	are compared with those predicted by photochemical models: we calculate
	that for many neutral species, DR has larger production rates than
	neutral chemistry. Concerning molecular growth in Titan’s ionosphere,
	DR is shown to have two antagonistic effects: (1) a global chemical
	lysis of ions through C–C and C–N bond breaking (missed by the “H-loss”
	DR paradigm); and (2) an enhancement of the neutral chemistry by
	production of reactive radicals, such as C2H or NH2. Further exploration
	of this chemistry requires the development of ionospheric coupled
	models taking explicitly into account the richness of the DR process
	and the strong impact of ions on the budget of neutral species. This
	study emphasizes also the urgent need of additional experimental
	studies about DR of molecular ions, with two priorities: evaluation
	of the impact of the temperature of ions on the rates and fragmentation

	The measurements were carried out using the classic FALP technique

	= 2.8 × 10-7 cm3 s-1. The temperature variation for T ~ 100-300 K
	observed for e(HCO+) is similar to that of N2H+ ions for T ~ 300-500
	K. The smaller rate coefficient measured for DCO+ and N2D+ ions shows
	the influence of an isotope effect. The substantial enhancement of
	the vibrational level, ' = 6, from the N2B state for N2H+ recombination

  abstract = {A new approach is presented applicable in framework of model calibration
	to observed data. The approach consists of a combination of the Generalized
	Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation technique (GLUE) and Global Sensitivity
	Analysis (GSA). The method is based on multiple model evaluations.
	The GSA is a quantitative, model independent approach and is based
	on estimating the fractional contribution of each input factor to
	the variance of the model output, also accounting for interaction
	terms. In GLUE, the model runs are classified according to a likelihood
	measure, conditioning each run to observations. In calibration procedures,
	strong interaction is observed between model parameters, due to model
	over-parameterization. The use of likelihood measures allows an estimate
	of the posterior joint pdf of parameters. By performing a GSA to
	the likelihood measure, input factors mainly driving model runs with
	good fit to data are identified. Moreover GSA allows highlighting
	the basic features of the interaction structure. Any other tool subsequently
	adopted to represent in more detail the interaction structure, from
	correlation coefficients to Principal Component Analysis to Bayesian
	networks to tree-structured density estimation, confirms the general
	features identified by GSA.},

	types. The primary function of the guidelines was not to constrain
	the actual process of developing a parameter distribution but rather
	to establish a series of well-defined steps where recognized methods
	would be consistently applied to all parameters. An important guideline
	was to use a small set of distributions satisfying the maximum entropy
	formalism. Another important guideline was the consistent use of
	the log transform for parameters with large ranges (i.e. maximum/minimum>103).
	A parameter development team assigned 67 probability density functions

	from Saturn's magnetosphere interact with the upper atmosphere producing

	system mediates the interaction between Titan and the external environment.
	New insights into Titan's ionosphere are being facilitated by data
	from several instruments onboard the Cassini Orbiter, although the
	Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) measurements will be emphasized
	here. We present dayside ionosphere models and compare the results
	with both RPWS/LP (Radio and Plasma Wave - Langmuir Probe) and INMS
	data, exploring the sensitivity of models to ionospheric chemistry
	schemes and solar flux variations. Modeled electron densities for
	the dayside leg of T18 and all of T17 (dayside) had reasonable agreement
	with the measured RPWS electron densities and INMS total ion densities.
	Magnetospheric inputs make at best minor contributions to the ionosphere
	for these flybys, at least for altitudes above about 1000 km. At
	lower (<1100 km) altitudes, the total ion densities measured by the
	INMS are less than the electron densities measured by the RPWS/LP
	which could be due to heavy (>100 daltons) ions, which the INMS is
	not able to detect. Qualitatively, INMS spectra exhibit the same
	ion species and 12 amu family separations for the dayside ionospheres
	of T17 and T18 as were seen in the mass spectra measured during T5
	(nightside). However, the relative abundance of high mass (m > 50)
	ion species is about 10 times less for the dayside T17 and T18 passes
	than it was for the polar nightside T5 flyby, which can perhaps be
	explained in several ways including differences in neutral composition,
	less dissociative recombination on the nightside than on the dayside
	(due to lower electron densities and affecting heavier ion species
	more than lighter ones), and transport of longer-lived high mass
	species from day to night.},

	excited. Also the molecules resulting from association at the surface

	follow up processes as negative ion formation by dissociative attachment.

	conversion in a Radio Frequency dusty plasma experiment simulating

	aerosols have been produced in different N2-CH4 gas mixtures. Using
	in situ mass spectrometry, it has been found that, by varying the
	initial methane concentration, aerosols could be produced in methane
	steady state concentrations similar to Titan's atmospheric conditions.
	In our experiment, an initial ~5% methane concentration is necessary
	to ensure a ~1.5% methane steady state concentration in the plasma.
	The tholin mass production rate has been quantified as a function
	of the initial methane concentration. A maximum was found for a steady
	state CH4 concentration in agreement with Titan's atmospheric CH4
	concentrations. At this maximum, the tholin C/N ratio is about 1.45
	and the carbon gas to solid conversion yield is about 35%. We have
	modelled the mass production rate by a parabolic function, highlighting
	two competitive chemical regimes controlling the tholin production
	efficiency: an efficient growth process which is proportional to
	the methane consumption, and an inhibiting process which opposes
	the growth process and dominates it for initial methane concentrations
	higher than ~5%. To explain these two opposite effects, we propose
	two mechanisms: one involving HCN patterns in the tholins for the
	growth process, and one involving the increasing amount of atomic
	hydrogen in the plasma as well as the increase in aliphatic contributions
	in the tholins for the inhibiting process. This study highlights
	new routes for understanding the chemical growth of the organic aerosols

	called the L-shaped BONUS, incorporates the reweighting scheme to
	ease the computational load in the second stage recourse function
	calculation. The reweighting idea has previously been successfully
	used in optimization in BONUS, also an algorithm to solve the SNLP
	problems. The proposed algorithm is analyzed using different case
	study problems, including a blending problem relevant to the process
	industry and a large scale, novel sensor placement problem for water
	security networks. The results for all the problems show considerable
	savings in the computational time without compromising the accuracy,
	the performance being better for the Hammersley sequence sampling

	Identifying underlying physical differences between the various experimental

	on the dissociative recombination of these major ionospheric species
	of ions. For T < 1200 K, we conclude that the recombination rates

	vibrational states respectively are 2.2 $\times$ $10^{-7}$ (Te/300)$^{-0.39}$

	Vibrational excitation is shown to play a significant role in laboratory

  abstract = {Discovery by Cassini's plasma instrument of heavy positive and negative
	ions within Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere has advanced
	our understanding of ion neutral chemistry within Titan's upper atmosphere,
	primarily composed of molecular nitrogen, with ~2.5% methane. The
	external energy flux transforms Titan's upper atmosphere and ionosphere
	into a medium rich in complex hydrocarbons, nitriles and haze particles
	extending from the surface to 1200 km altitudes. The energy sources
	are solar UV, solar X-rays, Saturn's magnetospheric ions and electrons,
	solar wind and shocked magnetosheath ions and electrons, galactic
	cosmic rays (GCR) and the ablation of incident meteoritic dust from
	Enceladus' E-ring and interplanetary medium. Here it is proposed
	that the heavy atmospheric ions detected in situ by Cassini for heights
	>950 km, are the likely seed particles for aerosols detected by the
	Huygens probe for altitudes <100 km. These seed particles may be
	in the form of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) containing
	both carbon and hydrogen atoms CnHx. There could also be hollow shells
	of carbon atoms, such as C60, called fullerenes which contain no
	hydrogen. The fullerenes may compose a significant fraction of the
	seed particles with PAHs contributing the rest. As shown by Cassini,
	the upper atmosphere is bombarded by magnetospheric plasma composed
	of protons, H2+ and water group ions. The latter provide keV oxygen,
	hydroxyl and water ions to Titan's upper atmosphere and can become
	trapped within the fullerene molecules and ions. Pickup keV N2+,
	N+ and CH4+ can also be implanted inside of fullerenes. Attachment
	of oxygen ions to PAH molecules is uncertain, but following thermalization
	O+ can interact with abundant CH4 contributing to the CO and CO2
	observed in Titan's atmosphere. If an exogenic keV O+ ion is implanted
	into the haze particles, it could become free oxygen within those
	aerosols that eventually fall onto Titan's surface. The process of
	freeing oxygen within aerosols could be driven by cosmic ray interactions
	with aerosols at all heights. This process could drive pre-biotic
	chemistry within the descending aerosols. Cosmic ray interactions
	with grains at the surface, including water frost depositing on grains
	from cryovolcanism, would further add to abundance of trapped free
	oxygen. Pre-biotic chemistry could arise within surface microcosms
	of the composite organic-ice grains, in part driven by free oxygen
	in the presence of organics and any heat sources, thereby raising
	the astrobiological potential for microscopic equivalents of Darwin's
	"warm ponds" on Titan.},

  journal = {NeuroImage},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {In Press, Accepted Manuscript},
  pages = { - },
  abstract = {Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a powerful method for determining
	the most likely among a set of competing hypotheses about the mechanisms
	that generated observed data. BMS has recently found widespread application
	in neuroimaging, particularly in the context of dynamic causal modelling
	(DCM). However, so far, combining BMS results from several subjects
	has relied on simple (fixed effects) metrics, e.g. the group Bayes
	factor (GBF), that do not account for group heterogeneity or outliers.
	In this paper, we compare the GBF with two random effects methods
	for BMS at the between-subject or group level. These methods provide
	inference on model-space using a classical and Bayesian perspective
	respectively. First, a classical (frequentist) approach uses the
	log model evidence as a subject-specific summary statistic. This
	enables one to use analysis of variance to test for differences in
	log-evidences over models, relative to inter-subject differences.
	We then consider the same problem in Bayesian terms and describe
	a novel hierarchical model, which is optimised to furnish a probability
	density on the models themselves. This new variational Bayes method
	rests on treating the model as a random variable and estimating the
	parameters of a Dirichlet distribution which describes the probabilities
	for all models considered. These probabilities then define a multinomial
	distribution over model space, allowing one to compute how likely
	it is that a specific model generated the data of a randomly chosen
	subject as well as the exceedance probability of one model being
	more likely than any other model. Using empirical and synthetic data,
	we show that optimising a conditional density of the model probabilities,
	given the log-evidences for each model over subjects, is more informative
	and appropriate than both the GBF and frequentist tests of the log-evidences.
	In particular, we found that the hierarchical Bayesian approach is
	considerably more robust than either of the other approaches in the
	presence of outliers. We expect that this new random effects method
	will prove useful for a wide range of group studies, not only in
	the context of DCM, but also for other modelling endeavours, e.g.
	comparing different source reconstruction methods for EEG/MEG or
	selecting among competing computational models of learning and decision-making.},

	transfer in mid-2006 allowed low emission angle observations of the

	us to probe the full latitude range. We present the first measurements
	of composition variations within the polar vortex, which display
	increasing abundances right up to 90°[thin space]N. The lack of a
	homogeneous abundance-latitude variation within the vortex indicates
	limited horizontal mixing and suggests that subsidence is greatest
	at the vortex core. Contrary to numerical model predictions and tropospheric
	cloud observations, we do not see any evidence for a secondary circulation
	cell near the south pole, which suggests a single Hadley-type circulation
	in the stratosphere at this epoch. This difference can be reconciled
	if the secondary cell is restricted to altitudes below 100 km, where
	there is no sensitivity in our data. Temporal variations in composition
	were observed in the south, with volatile species becoming less abundant
	as the season progressed. The observed variations are compared to

	of irradiating gas mixtures with a monochromatic photon beam, from
	the methane ionization threshold at 12.6 eV, up to and beyond the

	Three gas mixtures of increasing complexity were used: N2/CH4 (0.96/0.04),
	N2/CH4/C2H2 (0.96/0.04/0.001), and N2/CH4/C2H2/C2H4 (0.96/0.04/0.001/0.001).
	The resulting ions were detected with a high-resolution (1 T) FT-ICR
	mass spectrometer as a function of time and VUV photon energy. In
	order to interpret the experimental results, a Titan ionospheric
	model was adapted to the laboratory conditions. This model had previously
	allowed the identification of the ions detected in the Titan upper
	atmosphere by the ion neutral mass spectrometer (INMS) onboard the
	Cassini spacecraft. Comparison between observed and modeled ion densities
	validates the kinetic model (reactions, rate constants, product branching
	ratios) for the primary steps of molecular growth. It also reveals
	differences that we attribute to an intense surface chemistry. This
	result implies that heterogeneous chemistry on aerosols might efficiently
	produce HCN and NH3 in the Titan upper atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The interaction of matter with its environment is the driving force
	behind the evolution of 99% of the observed matter in the universe.
	The majority of the visible universe exists in a state of weak ionization,
	the so called fourth state of matter: plasma. Plasmas are ubiquitous,
	from those occurring naturally; interstellar molecular clouds, cometary
	comae, circumstellar shells, to those which are anthropic in origin;
	flames, combustion engines and fusion reactors. The evolution of
	these plasmas is driven by the interaction of the plasma constituents,
	the ions, and the electrons. One of the most important subsets of
	these reactions is electron-molecular ion recombination. This process
	is significant for two very important reasons. It is an ionization
	reducing reaction, removing two ionised species and producing neutral
	products. Furthermore, these products may themselves be reactive
	radical species which can then further drive the evolution of the
	plasma. The rate at which the electron reacts with the ion depends
	on many parameters, for examples the collision energy, the internal
	energy of the ion, and the structure of the ion itself. Measuring
	these properties together with the manner in which the system breaks
	up is therefore critical if the evolution of the environment is to
	be understood at all. Several techniques have been developed to study
	just such reactions to obtain the necessary information on the parameters.
	In this paper the focus will be on one the most recently developed
	of these, the Ion Storage Ring, together with the detection tools
	and techniques used to extract the necessary information from the
	reaction. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., Mass Spec Rev 27: 485-530,

	estimated from the strength of Titan's 3[nu]3 CH4 Q branch and is
	at least 25 times the value for the column abundance of Mars' atmosphere.
	Moreover, the enhanced strength of the weaker CH4 lines in Titan's
	spectrum relative to Saturn's spectrum suggests that CH4 constitutes
	a significant fraction of this bulk. Recently discovered strong,
	unidentified absorptions in Titan's spectrum at 1.05-1.06 [mu]m have
	been compared with laboratory spectra of a number of gases including
	CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H8 with negative results. These comparisons,
	however, have not excluded the possibility that these features arise
	from a very large quantity of CH4 or from an isotope of CH4. The
	fundamental transition of the responsible molecule may affect the
	interpretation of Titan's 8-14 [mu]m spectrum since its wavelength
	may lie in this window. Comparison with Uranus' spectrum suggests
	that the visible abundance of this molecule in Titan's atmosphere
	may be much greater than in Uranus' relatively clear, deep atmosphere.
	Spectra of features at [lambda]8150.7 and [lambda]8272.7 attributed
	possibly to H2 have been obtained at high resolution also during
	the apparitions of 1971, 1972, and 1973. These are presented for
	comparison with the results of the 1970 apparition. The existence
	of the [lambda]8150.7 feature is established definitively but further

  abstract = {Heat treatments can have considerable influence on the droplet size
	distribution of oil-in-water emulsions. In the present study, high-pressure
	(HP) pasteurisation and sterilisation were evaluated as alternatives
	for heat preservation of emulsions. HP conditions used were 600 MPa,
	5 min, room temperature and 800 MPa, 5 min, 80 °C initial temperature,
	115 °C maximum temperature for HP pasteurisation and HP sterilisation
	respectively. The effects on droplet size of these conditions were
	compared to heat treatments for whey protein isolate (WPI) and soy
	protein isolate (SPI) emulsions at two pH values and two ionic strengths.
	For WPI, also the effect of protein in the bulk phase was evaluated.
	Both HP and heat pasteurisation treatments resulted in similar or
	slightly decreased average droplet sizes compared to the untreated
	samples. For neutral SPI emulsions, heat sterilisation increased
	the average droplet size from 1.6 [mu]m to 43.7 [mu]m, while HP sterilisation
	resulted only in a small increase towards an average droplet size
	of 2.1 [mu]m. The neutral WPI emulsions, except those with a high
	ionic strength, gave similar results with respect to the droplet
	size, showing that for neutral pH WPI or SPI emulsions HP sterilisation
	is preferable above heat sterilisation. Concerning the low pH WPI
	emulsions, the droplet sizes were unaffected after both heat and
	HP sterilisation.Industrial relevance Heat pasteurisation and sterilisation
	are effective treatments to preserve food products that are based
	on emulsions with respect to microbial safety. However, heat treatments
	can negatively affect emulsion stability. Currently, in addition
	to high pressure at room temperature, high-pressure treatments at
	elevated temperature received a great deal of interest to achieve
	sterilised products. This study evaluated the effects of both heat
	and high-pressure pasteurisation and sterilisation on droplet size
	of whey protein isolate and soy protein isolate emulsions. It was
	shown that for pasteurisation treatments, both heat and high pressure
	have minor effects on the droplet size of the emulsion. However,
	for sterilisation purposes high-pressure treatment is preferable
	for emulsion at neutral pH. High-pressure sterilisation can therefore
	be interesting alternatives to heat treatments to preserve emulsion
	stability.},

	able to reproduce the full set of stratospheric molecular mixing
	ratios inferred from observations. In order to assess how well reaction
	sets describe hydrocarbon chemistry, theoretical modeling predictions
	were compared to the results of a laboratory experiment. A CH4-C2H2
	mixture was irradiated at 185 nm in an atmospheric simulation chamber
	and the evolution of the gas mixture was followed in situ and in
	real time by infrared spectroscopy. In parallel, a 0D theoretical
	model of the laboratory experiment was developed. A new reaction
	set describing Titan's chemistry was built and incorporated in the
	model. Lebonnois et al. [Lebonnois, S., Toublanc, D., Hourdin, F.,
	Rannou, P., 2001. Icarus 152, 384-406] reaction set was also used
	for comparison. The presence of small amounts of atmospheric O2 in
	the experiment was properly accounted for and led us to suggest that
	oxygenated chemistry might be a source of C2H4 in Titan's atmosphere.
	With Lebonnois et al. [Lebonnois, S., Toublanc, D., Hourdin, F.,
	Rannou, P., 2001. Icarus 152, 384-406] reaction set, the model could
	not fit at all the experimental evolution of the compounds. This
	is explained by some of the choices made for crucial kinetic parameters
	such as the quantum yield of photolysis of C2H2. Also, the absence
	of some reactions led to the enhancement of pathways that would otherwise
	be negligible. For example, the lack of reactions between C4H4 and
	radicals induced an erroneously high photolysis rate for this species.
	With the reaction set built in this study, the model much better
	fits the experiment, especially when the {soot,} which includes C4H4,
	is recycled into C2H2. This shows that photochemistry of the larger
	species has a role in determining the lighter species concentrations
	and that considering that they are simply lost from the system is
	not a valid assumption. Including even an abridged set of C4 + hydrocarbon
	reactions will be required in future photochemical models. Especially,
	photolysis rates and yields for C2H2, C4H2, and C4H4, are important
	parameters in need of a better determination.},

	approach, rather than at closest approach. We show that this behavior
	can be explained by recombination of phenyl radicals (C6H5) with
	H atoms on the walls of the instrument and that the measured signal
	is a combination of (1) C6H6 from the atmosphere and (2) C6H6 formed
	within the instrument. In parallel, we investigate Titan benzene
	chemistry with a set of photochemical models. A model for the ionosphere
	predicts that the globally averaged production rate of benzene by
	ion-molecule reactions is &#8764;107 cm&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, of the

	This result is consistent with the phenyl/benzene ratio required

	and two Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) sensors, the Ion beam
	Spectrometer (IBS) and the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), have revealed
	the presence of a significant population of heavy hydrocarbon and
	nitrile species well above the homopause, with masses as large as
	several thousand Daltons (Da). The INMS ion and neutral spectra cover
	the mass range 1â100 Da. The IBS has measured positive ions up
	to 350 Da, while the ELS has detected concentrations of negative
	ions as high as 20% of the total negatively charged ionosphere component
	extending to over 13,000 Da. These measurements have motivated the
	development of new atmospheric models and have significant implications
	for our knowledge and understanding of Titan's haze layers.
	
	
	 The existence of a thick haze obscuring Titan's surface was inferred
	from remote-sensing observations at infrared and ultraviolet
	
	 wavelengths during the mid-1970s (Danielson et al. 1973; Veverka
	1973; Zellner 1973; Trafton 1975) and confirmed by Voyager 1 and
	2 imaging, which revealed the existence of two principal haze layers,
	a main layer and a
	
	 thin detached layer ~100 km above it, both merging at high northern
	latitudes (Smith et al. 1981, 1982). It was recognized early on (e.g.,
	Danielson et al. 1973) that photochemistry occurring in the upper
	atmosphere of Titan was the likely source of the haze-forming aerosols,
	and in
	
	 the years leading up to the Voyager encounters several laboratory
	experiments were performed in an attempt to synthesize materials
	
	 whose properties were similar to those of the postulated hazes (see
	reviews by Chang et al. 1979 and Cabane and Chassefière 1995). Substances
	investigated as possible candidates for the haze-forming aerosols
	included polymers of acetylene, ethylene,
	
	 and HCN (Scattergood and Owen 1977; Podolak and Bar-Nun 1979) and
	“tholins,” complex organic solids, brownish in color, produced in
	a simulated reducing planetary atmosphere through
	
	 UV irradiation and electric discharge (Khare and Sagan 1973; Sagan
	and Khare 1979).
	
	
	 Prior to the Voyager encounters, the only species known with certainty
	to be present in Titan's atmosphere were CH4 and C2H6, although there
	was evidence for the presence of C2H2 and C2H4 as well (Gillett 1975).
	The presence of N2, predicted by Hunten (1977) and Atreya et al.
	(1978), had not yet been established, although Titan's reddish-brown
	albedo suggested that nitrogen-bearing species (and/or sulfur-bearing
	
	 ones) should be present in the haze aerosols (Scattergood and Owen
	1977; Chang et al. 1979). The Voyagers revealed that Titan's atmosphere
	consists predominantly (&gt;90%) of molecular nitrogen (Broadfoot
	et al. 1981; Tyler et al. 1981) with methane as the next most abundant
	species and provided positive identifications of several hydrocarbons
	including C2H2, C2H4, and C3H8 as well as of the nitriles HCN, HC3N,
	and C2N2 (Hanel et al. 1981, 1982; Kunde et al. 1981; Maguire et
	al. 1981).
	
	
	 During the interval between the Voyager encounters and the arrival
	of Cassini in the Saturn system, several photochemical
	
	 models were developed to describe the production of hydrocarbons
	and nitriles resulting from the dissociation of N2 and CH4 in Titan's
	upper atmosphere by electron impact (N2) and UV irradiation (CH4)
	(e.g., Yung et al. 1984; Toublanc et al. 1995; Wilson and Atreya
	2004). More a number of laboratory, modeling, and theoretical studies
	were undertaken to investigate the formation of the haze
	
	 layers and the physical, optical, and chemical properties of the
	aerosols in light of both the Voyager data and new remote-sensing
	
	 observations (see reviews by Cabane and Chassefière 1995 and McKay
	et al. 2001). Post-Voyager experiments to synthesize aerosol analogs
	in the laboratory involved both the production of tholins in a simulated
	
	 Titan N2-CH4 atmosphere (e.g., Thompson et al. 1994; Coll et al.
	1999) and the creation of the photopolymers of C2H2, C2H4, and HCN
	(Bar-Nun et al. 1988; Scattergood et al. 1992) as well as of HC3N
	and HC3N/C2H2 (Clarke and Ferris 1997). The spectral and optical
	properties of tholins were found to be consistent with Titan's albedo
	and with the refractive
	
	 properties of Titan's haze particles, suggesting that tholins are
	good analogs for Titan's aerosols (Khare et al. 1984).
	
	
	 The ultimate sources of Titan's aerosols are the gas-phase dissociation
	products of CH4 and N2. However, as noted by Lebonnois et al. (2002),
	the transition from gas-phase compounds to solid-phase aerosols is
	poorly understood. They suggested three possible chemical
	
	 pathways that could polymerize simple molecules to macromolecules,
	which are the presumed precursors to aerosol particles,
	
	 producing: (1) polymers of acetylene and cyanoacetylene, (2) polycyclic
	aromatics, and (3) polymers of HCN and other nitriles,
	
	 and polyynes. Their model suggested a total production rate of 4
	× 10−14 g cm−2 s−1 and a C/N ratio of 4, in a production zone slightly
	lower than 200 km altitude. Wilson and Atreya (2003) considered similar
	pathways and concluded that the growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
	(PAH) throughout the lower
	
	 stratosphere could play an important role in haze formation. They
	suggested that the peak chemical production of haze would
	
	 lie near 220 km, with a column integrated production rate of 3.2
	× 10−14 g cm−2 s−1. Wilson and Atreya (2003) pointed out that the
	discovery of benzene in Titan's atmosphere by ISO (Coustenis et al.
	2003) favored the PAH pathway. Trainer et al. (2004) found that for
	particles produced from a mixture of 10% CH4 in N2 the results were
	consistent with a large fraction of aromatics, including specific
	mass spectral peaks likely due to PAHs.
	
	 However, at lower concentrations of CH4 (1% and lower), the mass
	fraction of PAHs greatly diminished, and an aliphatic pathway dominated.
	
	
	 Laboratory simulations also indicate a possible key role for PAHs.
	Khare et al. (2002) reported on an analysis of the time-dependent
	chemical evolution of gas phase products in a Titan simulation. They
	found
	
	 an early dominance of aromatic ring structures that led in the later
	stages of the experiment to the appearance of nitrile
	
	 and amine compounds. Thompson et al. (1991) reported the yields of
	gaseous hydrocarbons and nitriles produced at pressures (1,700 Pa
	and 24 Pa) in a continuous-flow,
	
	 low-dose, cold plasma discharge excited in an atmosphere consisting
	of 10% CH4 and 90% N2 at 295 K. At 1,700 Pa, 59 gaseous species including
	27 nitriles were detected while at 24 Pa, 19 species are detected,
	including
	
	 six nitriles and three other unidentified N-bearing compounds. The
	types of molecules formed changed even more markedly, with
	
	 high degrees of multiple bonding at 24 Pa prevailing over more H-saturated
	molecules at 1,700 Pa. Imanaka et al. (2004) conducted a series of
	experiments from high (2,300 Pa) to low (13 Pa) pressure. They found
	an increase in the aromatic compounds
	
	 and a decrease in C/N ratio in tholins formed at low pressures, indicating
	the presence of the nitrogen-containing polycyclic
	
	 aromatic compounds in tholins formed at low pressures. They concluded
	that the haze layers at various altitudes might have
	
	 different chemical and optical properties, but most importantly they
	found that there is a fundamental change in the nature
	
	 of haze production between pressures above and below roughly 100
	Pa.},

	A quantitative probabilistic method for uncertainty analysis includes:
	(1) quantifying and assigning probabilistic distributions to the
	input uncertainties, (2) sampling the distributions of these uncertain
	parameters in an iterative fashion using Monte Carlo methods, (3)
	propagating the effects of uncertainties through the model, and (4)
	predicting the outcomes in terms of probabilistic measures like mean,
	variance, and fractiles. However, the results of the probabilistic
	analysis depend on the number of samples chosen. The sample size
	required for a particular analysis depends on various factors such
	as type of model, the random number generator used, type of distributions,
	and the output probabilistic measure and cannot be universally defined.
	The general tendency is to reduce the samples as much as possible
	without realizing the effect on decisions. For example, the mean
	of the output requires a number of samples that is an order of magnitude
	less compared to the variance. Therefore, it is desirable to use
	a sampling technique that can predict the output probabilistic measure
	accurately with the minimum number of samples. In this work, we present
	new sampling techniques based on Quasi-Monte Carlo sequences and

	the incremental reactivities of individual organic compounds and
	for RAFs for motor vehicle exhaust, accounting for uncertainties

	in exhaust composition. Uncertainties (1sigma) in incremental reactivities
	of individual compounds range from about 25 to 75\% of mean estimates
	and are typically about 10\% higher than previous estimates obtained
	by considering independent rate parameters as the only source of
	uncertainty in the chemical mechanism. The incremental reactivities
	of relatively rapidly reacting compounds are sensitive to the peroxy
	radical yields in their primary oxidation reactions. RAF values of
	0.87 +- 0.11 (1sigma) and 0.42 +- 0.06, respectively, are calculated
	for exhaust emissions from a test gasoline with low aromatics and
	low olefins content, and from an 85% methanol, 15% gasoline blend.

  abstract = {Dissociative recombination (DR) is a process in which a positive molecular
	ion recombines with an electron and subsequently dissociates into

	In order to shed more light upon this process the storage ring technique
	has been introduced and utilised extensively for the last few decades.
	This thesis is devoted to experimental studies into the DR reaction
	at the storage ring CRYRING. The DR reaction has been investigated
	for the following molecular ions; Na+(D2O), PD2+, O3+, N3+, H2+,
	D2H+, OPCl+, OPCl2+ and H3O+, with the aim to ascertain rotational
